The Industrial Revolution brought severe consequences to Indian society.
The fall and destruction of the urban and rural handicraft industry was one of the most significant effects of British Rule..
The Industrial Revolution in England also affected the textile industries in India in many ways, such as:

English textiles were now posing a serious threat to Indian textiles in the European and American markets.
Textiles from India were subject to high taxes in Britain.
The African markets were successfully taken over by cheap, machine-made textiles from Britain.
By the 1830s, inexpensive British manufactured products had inundated the Indian marketplaces. The Indian textile industries suffered as a result of them being less expensive than Indian textiles.


Following the Industrial Revolution, Britain began making textiles by a machine that were considerably more affordable and of higher quality than conventional Indian textile.
The start of the industrial revolution had a negative impact on the Indian handicraft in India.
Additionally, the decline of the kings, chieftains, and zamindars who served as the employers of these masters of handicrafts led to the steady expansion of British dominion in India through outright battles with the rulers, which resulted in the suffering of handicrafts in India.

Statement 1 is correct: The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was a political agreement signed by Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin, Viceroy of India, on 5 March 1931 before the Second Round Table Conference in London, where the Indian National Congress was invited to participate.
Statement 2 is correct: Withdrawal of all ordinances issued by the Government of India imposing curbs on the activities of the Indian National Congress was agreed by the Viceroy. Statement 3 is incorrect: The demand for a public enquiry of excesses committed by police during the civil disobedience movement was rejected by the Viceroy.
Statement 4 is correct: Release of all political prisoners, except those guilty of violence was also agreed.
NOTE: if we read Ncert, statement 1 is general and common. Securing participation by the Indian National Congress in the Second Round Table Conference was an important agenda of pact inter-alia. We also know that viceroy rejected commutation of the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev to a life sentence, which was criticised by several leaders. This underlines that prisoners with violence charges were not released. This reasoning makes statement 4 correct. Option (b) i.e 1, 2 and 4 only is the only option with statement 1 and 4 in it !!**

Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: British Expansionist Policy
The system aimed to establish British paramountcy over the Indian States and to ensure their military and political subservience to the British East India Company. Securing a fixed income for the company was not the primary objective of the system.
Subsidiary Alliance by Wellesley (1798- 1805):

Allying Indian states maintained the British army at its frontier and paid for their maintenance. Ruler had to post British officials at their Ruler couldn’t employ Europeans without the British’s permission. Couldn’t contact enemies to make peace.
Maintenance asked was high → Ruler’s couldn’t pay → asked to cede part of their territory.

Both the given measures were taken by the Colonial Government as a result of Santhal Uprising.
Santhal Uprising:

Santhals: They used to live in the Daman- i-Koh area which is between Bhagalpur and Rajmahal, and ‘hool’ means uprising in the Santhali language.
The Santhals of the Rajmahal Hills were resentful of the oppression they suffered at the hands of revenue officials, police, money- lenders, and landlords, by the “outsiders” (whom they called diku).
In 1854, the Santhals under the leadership of Sido and Kanhu rebelled against their oppressors, declared the end of the Company’s control, and proclaimed their independence.
The situation wasn’t brought under control until 1856, a year that saw extensive military Sido died in 1855, while Kanhu was arrested in 1866.
A separate district of Santhal Parganas was created by the Government to pacify the Santhals. Thus, the government separated Santhal Parganas into its own district in order to pacify the Santhals.
It became illegal for a Santhal to transfer land to a non-Santhal. British Government enacted laws so that the lands of tribals could not be taken by outsiders (dikus).**

- (b) Active involvement of Dalit and Tribal communities of India in the National Movement
- (c) Joining of peasant unrest to India’s National Movement
- (d) Drastic decrease in the cultivation of plantation crops and commercial crops
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Phase of Mahatma Gandhi Champaran Satyagraha (1917):

Mahatma Gandhi’s initial experiment of satyagraha was known as Champaran Satyagraha.
It was undertaken after Mahatma Gandhi learned about the abuses suffered by farmers, who were forced into growing indigo by British planters and estate
The tenants from Champaran were forced under the law to grow indigo on 3/20th part of the land (Tinkathia System) for his landlord.
To increase their profits, European planters demanded exorbitant rents and illegitimate
Rajkumar Shukla invited Gandhi to look into the problems of Indigo planters in Champaran, Bihar.
Gandhiji intended to conduct a thorough investigation in the district and demand action based on its results.
During this time Gandhiji was even charged with violating law and was told to leave Champaran, but he refused to leave.
Later, the then Lieutenant Governor of Bihar ordered the withdrawal of the case against Gandhi, and the Collector wrote to Gandhi saying he was free to conduct the inquiry.
In the history of the independence struggle, this tiny step in the form of passive protest was a great leap, signalling the beginning of the Gandhian period.
Leaders associated: Rajendra Prasad, Mazhar-ul-Haq, Mahadeo Desai, Narhari Parekh, J.B. Kripalani etc.
Gandhi’s position in India’s resistance to the British raj was solidified by the victory at Champaran.





NOTE: in given statements, notice “all– India participation” in statement (a) and “Drastic decrease” in statement (d), we can take risk of eliminating these extreme statements. Always remember, there is no set rule for this “extreme word” elimination method. There are also some instances where sentences with extreme words were correct, for instance a question in 2017 about Foreign exchange of India. In the mentioned question, the statement with “drastic increase” was correct.**

### Question 8

Regarding Wood’s Dispatch, which of the following statements are true?

Grants-in-Aid system was introduced.
Establishment of universities was recommended.
English as a medium of instruction at all levels of education was recommended.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Reforms in Education during the British Time
Wood’s Dispatch (1854):

Magna Carta of English Education in India.
Government to take up the responsibility for the Education of masses.
Hierarchy of Educational Institutions
Emphasise on       Female,       Vocational Education and teachers’ training.
Secular Education in Government Institutions. 
Grants-in-aid to encourage private education.
Recommended English as the Medium of Instruction in higher studies and vernaculars in school level.
Universities with affiliations in three presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras.

Statement 1 and 2 are correct: Grants-in-aid to encourage private education and affiliating universities in the presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were recommended in the Wood’s Despatch.
Statement 3 is incorrect: The Woods Dispatch recommended English as the Medium of Instruction in higher studies and vernaculars in school level.




NOTE: Grants-in-Aid system and Establishment of universities was very popular recommendations of Woods Dispatch, so option 1 and 2 are correct. However, if you look carefully at option 3, it talks about English as a medium of instruction at all levels of education. Dispatch was in 1854, at that time introducing English as a medium of instruction at all levels sounds unconvincing. By applying this crude logic, and taking the risk of eliminating option 3, we can get the answer.**

The Act required the Company to yearly approve one lakh rupees for this Even this meagre sum, though, was not made accessible until 1823, mostly due to the disagreement over the most appropriate strategy for this investment.
The Charter Act of 1813 gave Christian missionaries the right to spread the English language and practise their religion.

General Committee on Public Instruction (1823):

A “General Committee of Public Instruction” was established by the Governor-General-in-Council in 1823 with the task of allocating one lakh rupees for educational purposes.
The General Committee of Public Instruction also was not able to decide the medium of instruction by vote; due to lack of majority.
Out of ten members of which Lord Macaulay was the president, five were supporters of English language or Anglicist as the medium of instruction and the rest were supporters of oriental or classic language or Classicists as a medium of instruction.
This is the famous Anglicist and Classicist controversy.
On February 2, 1835, Lord Macaulay, who served as head of the General Committee of Public Instruction, penned a minute in which he stated his position on the issue.
Through his minute, Lord Macaulay emphasised the use of the English language as a medium of instruction. He believed that English was the ideal language for instruction.

- (b) arbitrary powers to the management to quell industrial disputes.
- (c) an intervention by the British Court in the event of a trade dispute.
- (d) a system of tribunals and a ban on strikes.
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Labour Legislations
About the Trade Disputes Act, 1929:

The Trade Disputes Act, 1929 was codified for five years as an experimental measure.
The main objective of the Act was to make provisions for the establishment of Courts of Inquiry and Boards of Conciliation with a view to investigate and settle trade disputes.
The Act banned unnoticed strikes or lockouts in the provision of public utility services.
A strike or lockout that was intended to cause severe, widespread, or prolonged hardship for the community and compel the government to take or refrain from taking a particular course of action was also made illegal.
This included strikes and lockouts that had any purpose other than to advance a trade dispute within the trade or industry in which the strikers or the employers locking out were engaged.
The Act was amended in 1932 and was made permanent by the Trade Disputes (Extending) Act, 1934.**

### Question 3. Consider the following statements:

The Factories Act, 1881 was passed with a view to fix the wages of industrial workers and to allow the workers to form trade unions.
M. Lokhande was a pioneer in organizing the labour movement in British India.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Labour Legislations/Labour Movement
Statement 1 is incorrect: The first Factory Act (1881) was passed in 1881 during the tenure of Lord Ripon. This legislation aimed to improve working conditions for factory workers. This act applies only to factories that use mechanical power, employing at least 100 workers. It prohibited employment of children under the age 7. Children between the ages 7-12 were to work for a maximum 9 hours. It also made compulsory that dangerous machinery should be fenced properly, but no mention of forming trade unions.
Statement 2 is correct: Narayan Meghaji Lokhande (1848–1897) was the father of the trade union movement in India. He is remembered not only for ameliorating the working conditions of textile mill-hands in the 19th century but also for his courageous initiatives on caste and communal issues. Lokhande is acclaimed as the Father of the Trade Union Movement in India. Some of the rights mill workers got because of N M Lokhande were:

Mill workers should get a weekly holiday on Sunday
In the afternoon, workers should be entitled to half-hour recess.
The mill should start working from 6:30 in the morning and close by sunset.
The salaries of the workers should be given by the 15th of every month.




NOTE: From NCERT, we know that N.M. Lokhande was a pioneer of the labour movement in India and widely regarded as the “father of the trade union movement”. He also founded “Mill Hands’ Association”. If we critically think about statement 1, it states that Factories Act, 1881 allows the workers to form trade unions. It was the very first Factories Act, 1881. Do you think Britishers would give such a heavy right in its very first act rather than incremental moves? This reasoning makes the possibility of statement 1 being incorrect.
Read carefully about various personalities, at least about those which are mentioned in Modern NCERT. Personalities from Swadeshi Movement, Non-Cooperation Movement, CDM, Quit India Movement (esp. Underground activities) and various socio- religious reform movements are important.**

Sub-Theme: Phase of Mahatma Gandhi
Statement 1 is correct: Rowlatt Act was passed on the recommendations of the Sedition Committee chaired by Sir Sidney Rowlatt.
Statement 2 is correct: In organising his satyagraha, Gandhiji tried to utilise three types of political networks: The Home Rule Leagues; Certain Pan-Islamist groups and Satyagraha Sabha.
Statement 3 is incorrect: The two time periods are not the same. It has a gap of 9 years, the incident of Rowlatt Satyagraha took place in 1919 and the Demonstrations against the arrival of Simon Commission took place in 1928, thus the two events cannot coincide.

- (b) Imposition of restrictions on newspapers and magazines published in Indian languages
- (c) Removal of disqualifications imposed on the Indian magistrates with regard to the trial of the Europeans
- (d) Removal of a duty on imported cotton cloth
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Ilbert Bill controversy
Ilbert Bill Controversy (1883):

Two types of law that had been common in India were what Lord Ripon sought to abolish.
The legal system stipulated that a European could only be tried by a European Judge or a European Magistrate.
The disqualification was unfair, because it was intended to disgrace and discredit the judges who were of Indian descent.
A bill to end this prejudice in the judiciary was proposed in 1883 by lawmaker C.P. Ilbert. Europeans were vehemently against this Bill.
The Ilbert Bill controversy made educated Indians aware of the need of an all Indian organisation, resulting in the formation of Indian National Congress in 1885 in Bombay with early leadership of Dadabhai Naroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, WC Banerjee etc.
The Ilbert Bill Controversy is a high watermark in the history of the Indian National Movement. The immediate result of this awakening of India was the birth of the Indian National Congress in 1885, the very next year of Ripon’s departure.

Option (a) is incorrect: The Indian Arms Act (1878) imposed restrictions and it compelled the Indians to have license to keep, sell or purchase arms.
Option (b) is incorrect: The Vernacular Press Act (1878) posed restrictions on newspapers and magazines published in Indian languages.
Option (c) is  correct:  The  Ilbert  Bill Controversy 1883 was related to the removal of disqualifications imposed on the Indian magistrates with regard to the trial of the Europeans.
Option (d) is incorrect: On March 13th, 1879, Lord Lytton abolished the import duty on cotton goods except on the finest qualities and it has no relation with the Ilbert Bill controversy.**

### Question 2

The demand for the Tebhaga Peasant Movement in Bengal was for:

- (a) the reduction of the share of the landlords from one-half of the crop to one third.
- (b) the grant of ownership of land to peasants as they were the actual cultivators of the land.
- (c) the uprooting of Zamindari system and the end of serfdom.
- (d) writing off all peasant debts.
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Peasant Movement
Tebhaga Peasant Movement (1946) in Bengal demanded the share of the landlords to be reduced from one-half of the produce to one third of the produce.
Tebhaga Movement (1946):

In September 1946, the Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha gave a call to implement, through mass struggle, the Floud Commission recommendations of Tebhaga which means two-thirds’ share to the bargardars, the share-croppers also known as ‘bhagchasi’ or ‘adhyar’, instead of the one-half share.
The jotedars rented the land that the bargardars worked on.
The main slogan was “nij khamare dhan tolo,” which meant that sharecroppers should thresh their own paddy and not to the jotedar’s house, as before, so as to enforce tebhaga.
North Bengal was the epicentre of the movement, particularly among the Rajbanshis, a low caste with tribal origins. Muslims took part in great numbers as well.
The movement dissipated soon, as the League ministry’s sop of the Bargardari Bill, the popularisation of the Hindu Mahasabha’s campaign for a separate Bengal, and new riots in Calcutta, which eliminated the possibility of sympathetic support from the urban sections.




NOTE: If we read or Modern NCERT carefully, Tebhaga literally means ‘three shares’ of harvests. Option 1 talks about the “one-third” part. With just knowing the meaning of “Tebhaga’’, we can solve the given question.**

- (c) 1, 2 and 3
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: c

### Question 2

Consider the following statements:

The most effective contribution made by Dadabhai Naoroji to the cause of Indian National Movement was that he-

1. Exposed the economic exploitation of India by the British.

2. Interpreted the ancient Indian texts and restored the self-confidence of Indians.

3. Stressed the need for eradication of all the social evils before anything else.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Economic Exploitation of the British/Economic critics of colonialism
Statement 1 is correct: Dadabhai Naoroji (Grand Old man of India) wrote the “Poverty and UnBritish Rule in India” a Propounded Drain of Wealth Theory and exposed the economic exploitation of India by the British.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Vivekananda, etc. interpreted the ancient texts and restored the self confidence of Indians, not Dadabhai Naoroji. Swami Dayananda Saraswati even gave the call to “go back to vedas”.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Raja Rammohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Keshav Chandra Sen, Atmaram Pandurang, etc. emphasised the need for eradication of all social evils before anything else. Dadabhai Naoroji wasn’t a social reformer.
NOTE: If we carefully look at statement 3, it talks about the “eradication of all the social evils”. This sounds absolute and exclusive because of the extreme word “all”. Eliminating all social evils was a mammoth and uphill task. So there is less possibility of correctness of this statement. If we take calculable risk of eliminating statement 3, we can get an answer. Moreover, Dadabhai Naoroji propounded “Drain of wealth theory”. It was about exposing the economic exploitation of India by the British. This makes statement 1 correct. Economic Exploitation of the British/ Economic critics of colonialism theme is significant with respect to Colonial history in India. In the past, many questions came from this particular topic to check the analytical ability of aspirants.**

### Question 3

Consider the following:

Assessment of land revenue on the basis of nature of the soil and the quality of crops.
Use of mobile cannons in warfare.

Which of the above was/were introduced into India by the English?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2
- (c) 2 and 3
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Colonial Trade + Land Revenue Settlement
Statement 1 is incorrect: After getting the Diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1765 the major aim of the British East India Company was to increase their land revenue collection. So its policies were aimed at getting maximum income from land without caring of its consequences on cultivators and peasants. Three major systems of land revenue collection existed in India – Zamindari, Ryotwari and Mahalwari.
Statement 2 is incorrect: The first recorded use of Artillery in India is at the Battle of Adoni in 1368. In the Deccans the Bahamani kings led by Mohammand Shah Bahamani used a train of Artillery against the Raja of Vijaya-nagar.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Tobacco and Red Chillies were introduced by Portuguese not British.




NOTE: In general, assessment of land revenue on the basis of nature of the soil and the quality of crops itself cumbersome and administratively mammoth task. It also needs a high level of record-keeping practice on part of administration. So this statement sounds. Now, if we carefully go through Spectrum or Modern NCERT it is clear that Portuguese had introduced Tobacco in India.**

It was signed by Madan Mohan Malviya on behalf of Gandhi, and B. R. Ambedkar signed it on behalf of the depressed classes.
The background to the Poona Pact was the Communal Award of August 1932, which, among other things, reserved 71 seats in the central legislature for the depressed classes.
Gandhi, who opposed the Communal Award and believed it was a British effort to divide Hindus, started a fast unto death in order to have it overturned.
He rejected the concept of a special electorate for the depressed classes.
However, the number of seats set aside for them in provincial legislatures was increased to 147, and in the Central Legislature, they now make up 18% of all seats.
The findings of the Indian Franchise Committee, also known as the Lothian Committee, served as the foundation for the communal award.**

### Question 1

Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Land Revenue Settlement
Reforms of Cornwallis:

The Permanent Land Revenue Settlement of Bengal, which was extended to the provinces of Bihar and Orissa, was Lord Cornwallis’ most notable administrative
The reforms had increased the litigation after the introduction of the land settlement system and the main reason for this was the removal of Court Fee and now everybody could drag anybody to the courts.
The extension to the right of appeal was also one of the reasons court fees were abolished by Cornwallis and Lawyers were prescribed their fees.
Zamindari System:



The Zamindari System was introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1793 through the Permanent Settlement Act 1793.
The land where the zamindars had previously been responsible for collecting revenue was given to them as ownership.
The settlement is referred to as the Zamindari Settlement since it was made with the zamindars.
Since they were regarded as the soil’s tillers, the ryots were made tenants.
The demand for land revenue was predetermined and out of controlled revenue, 10/11th part was given to the 
Company also added the “Sunset clause” for the zamindars.




NOTE: Many questions came from this particular theme esp. Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari Settlement, Mahalwari Settlement. So understanding differences between them stands crucial.**

- (a) To agitate for Indian political reforms in the House of Commons
- (b) To campaign for the entry of Indians into the Imperial Judiciary
- (c) To facilitate a discussion on India’s Independence in the British Parliament
- (d) To agitate for the entry of eminent Indians into the British Parliament
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Administrative Reform post-1857
Together with Dadabhai Naoroji and other supporters of India, Sir William Wedderburn and W.  S.  Caine established the “Indian Parliamentary Committee” in 1893. The Indian Parliamentary Committee’s mission is to lobby the House of Commons for political reforms in India.
About Sir William Wedderburn:

President of INC: 1838-1918 (Bombay, 1889, Allahabad, 1910)
He came to India in 1860 and registered for work as an Assistant Collector at Dharwad.
His interest in these issues led him to contact the Indian National Congress.

Together with Dadabhai Naoroji and other supporters of India, Sir William Wedderburn and W. S. Caine established the “Indian Parliamentary Committee” in 1893. The Indian Parliamentary Committee’s mission is to lobby the House of Commons for political reforms in India.
In 1895, Wedderburn represented India on the Welby Commission (i.e. Royal Commission) on Indian Expenditure.
He also began participating in the activities of the Indian Famine Union set up in June 1901, for investigation into famines and proposing preventive measures.
He came to India in 1904 to attend the 20th session of the Indian National Congress in Bombay, which was presided over by Sir Henry Cotton.
He was again invited in 1910 to preside over the 25th session.
He remained the Chairman of the British Committee of the Congress from July 1889 until his death.





NOTE: By a general understanding of modern history, we know congress was established in 1885 and 1893 was a phase of early moderates and demands were mostly concentrated about reforms. Demand for India’s Independence came at a later stage. By this reasoning, we can eliminate option c.**

### Question 4

Which amongst the following provided a common factor for tribal insurrection in India in the 19th century?

- (a) Introduction of a new system of land revenue and taxation of tribal products
- (b) Influence of foreign religious missionaries in tribal areas
- (c) Rise of a large number of money lenders, traders and revenue farmers as middlemen in tribal areas
- (d) The complete disruption of the old agrarian order of the tribal communities
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Tribal Movement
The essence of Tribal life, i.e. shifting cultivation, hunting, fishing and the use of forest produce etc. was completely disrupted during the colonial rule.
Causes of Tribal Revolts in India in the 19th Century:

The cornerstone of Tribal life was shifting cultivation, hunting, fishing and the use of forest produce.
The practice of settled agriculture was established with the inflow of non-tribals into the traditional tribal lands and as a result of it the tribal population suffered a land loss.
There were restrictions imposed on the utilisation of forest products, shifting agriculture, and hunting methods. This led to the loss of livelihood for the tribals.
The tribals turned into landless agricultural laboures.
Money lenders were introduced by the British into the tribal regions, which greatly increased the exploitation of the native tribes. Under the new economic structure, they were reduced to bonded labour.
A joint ownership arrangement for land existed in tribal communities before the idea of private property took hold.
Tribal society has historically been egalitarian in contrast to mainstream society, which is characterised by caste and class However, with the arrival of non-tribals or outsiders, tribal people began to be seen as belonging to the lowest strata of society.
In order to manage the abundant riches of Indian forests, the government established a Forest Department in 1864. A comprehensive government monopoly on the forested land was created by the Govt Forest Act of 1865 and the Indian Forest Act of 1878.
The work of Christian missionaries also led to social unrest in tribal societies, which also aroused their resentment.
Major Tribal movements of 19th Century: Kol Rebellion (1832); Santhal Rebellion (1855-56); Munda Rebellion (1899-1900)




NOTE: option (d) sounds more inclusive and wider in coverage in terms of issues faced by tribals. It also includes the meaning and spirit of the above 3 sentences i.e. a, b, and c in one way or other. The options are ambiguous, hence we stuck to the official answer key of UPSC.**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Phase of Mahatma Gandhi
Statement 1 is correct: Kheda Satyagraha (1918) was  the first Non-cooperation Movement. Crops failed in Kheda district of Gujarat because of drought. The yield was less than 1/4th of normal produce so farmers were entitled to remission according to revenue code but the Government demanded taxes and ordered seizure of property, if not paid. Mahatma Gandhi asked the farmers not to pay the taxes and organise a satyagraha on behalf of the peasants. Leaders: Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Mohanlal Pandya, Narhari Parekh, etc. Government finally agreed to return all confiscated property, reduce the increase in tax, and suspend the tax for the year.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Permanent Settlement was introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1893 and it was confined in the areas of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Varanasi (United Provinces), Northern Karnataka. It was never introduced in Gujarat.**
