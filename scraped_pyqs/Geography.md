### Question 2

Consider the following statements:

1. The Red Sea receives very little precipitation in any form.

2. No water enters the Red Sea from rivers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Red Sea is a narrow strip of water extending southeastward from Suez, Egypt, for about 1,200 miles (1,930 km) to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects with the Gulf of Aden and thence with the Arabian Sea.
Climate:
The Red Sea region receives very little precipitation in any form, although prehistoric artifacts indicate that there were periods with greater amounts of rainfall. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Hydrology:
No water enters the Red Sea from rivers, and rainfall is scant, but the evaporation loss – in excess of 80 inches per year – is made up by an inflow through the eastern channel of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait from the Gulf of Aden. Hence, statement 2 is correct.**

---

### Question 3

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: The atmosphere is heated more by incoming solar radiation than by terrestrial radiation.

Statement-II: Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are good absorbers of long wave radiation.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I
- (c) Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect
- (d)  Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Statement-I is incorrect: Insolation reaches the earth’s surface in short waves and heat is radiated from the earth in long waves. The atmosphere is transparent to short waves and opaque to long waves. Hence, energy leaving the earth’s surface i.e. terrestrial radiation, heats up the atmosphere more than the incoming solar radiation i.e. insolation.
Statement-II is correct: The long-wave radiation is absorbed by atmospheric gases, particularly by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the Earth’s radiation.
Hence, statement-I is incorrect, but statement-II is correct.**

---

### Question 4

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: Thickness of the troposphere at the equator is much greater as compared to poles.

Statement-II: At the equator, heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explains Statement-I
- (c)   Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect
- (d)   Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct.
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
The troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere. Its average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
The thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents. This layer contains dust particles and water vapour. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Changes in climate and weather take place in the troposphere. This includes changes in atmospheric concentration of various gases, temperature and humidity, etc.
Hence, both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I.**

### Question 5

Consider the following:

1. Pyroclastic debris

2.  Ash and dust

3.  Nitrogen compounds

4 . Sulphur compounds

How many of the above are products of volcanic eruptions?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   Only three
- (d)   All four
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
A volcano is a place where gases, ashes and/or molten rock material – lava – escape to the ground. A volcano is called an active volcano if the materials mentioned are being released or have been released in the recent past.
Statement 1 is correct: The mantle contains a weaker zone called the asthenosphere. From this, the molten rock materials find their way to the surface. The material in the upper mantle portion is called magma. Once it starts moving towards the crust or reaches the surface, it is called lava. The material that reaches the ground includes: 

lava flows 


pyroclastic debris




volcanic bombs




ash and dust 




gases such as- 




nitrogen compounds


sulphur compounds 




minor amounts of chlorine, hydrogen and argon etc.**

### Question 6

Which of the following is/are correct inference/inferences from isothermal maps in the month of January?

1. The isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent.

2. The presence of cold ocean currents, Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift make the North Atlantic Ocean colder and the isotherms bend towards the north.

Select the answer using the code given below:

- (a)    1 only
- (b)    2 only
- (c)    Both 1 and 2
- (d)    Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: a
 Exp:
Statement 1 is correct: In the northern hemisphere, the land surface area is much larger than in the southern hemisphere. Hence, the effects of land mass and ocean currents are well-pronounced. The isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent. 
The effect of the ocean is well pronounced in the southern hemisphere. Here, the isotherms are more or less parallel to the latitudes, and the variation in temperature is more gradual than in the northern hemisphere.
Statement 2 is incorrect: North Atlantic Drift Current is part of a clockwise-setting ocean-current system in the North Atlantic Ocean, extending from southeast of the Grand Bank, off Newfoundland, Canada, to the Norwegian Sea, off northwestern Europe. It constitutes the northeastward extension of the Gulf Stream and is characterized by warm temperatures and high salinity.

With reference to the Himalayan rivers joining the Ganga downstream of Prayagraj from West to East, which one of the following sequences is correct?

- (a) Ghaghara – Gomati – Gandak – Kosi
- (b) Gomati – Ghaghara – Gandak – Kosi
- (c) Ghaghara – Gomati – Kosi – Gandak
- (d) Gomati – Ghaghara – Kosi – Gandak
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp:
Ganges River, rising in the Himalayas and emptying into the Bay of Bengal, drains one-fourth of the territory of India, and its basin supports hundreds of millions of people. The general direction of the river’s flow is from northwest to southeast. South of Haridwar, the river receives its principal right-bank tributary:
Yamuna River, which flows through the Delhi capital region and then roughly parallels the southeastward flow of the Ganges before joining it near Prayagraj (Allahabad).
The main left-bank tributaries of the Ganga are (from west to east- in the order of joining) :

Ramganga

### Question 9

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: Rainfall is one of the reasons for the weathering of rocks.

Statement-II: Rain water contains carbon dioxide in solution.

Statement-III: Rain water contains atmospheric oxygen.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)    Both Statement-II and Statement-III are correct and both of them explain Statement-I
- (b)    Both Statement-II and Statement-III are correct, but only one of them explains Statement-I
- (c)    Only one of the Statement II and III is correct and that explains Statement-I
- (d)    Neither Statement-II nor Statement-III is correct
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
Chemical weathering describes the process of chemicals in rainwater making changes to the minerals in a rock. Hence, Statement I is correct.
Carbon dioxide from the air is dissolved in rainwater, making it slightly acidic. A reaction can occur when the rainwater comes into contact with minerals in the rock, causing weathering. Hence, Statement II is correct.
Oxidation: This is the process in which atmospheric oxygen reacts with the rock to produce oxides. The process is called oxidation. The greatest impact of this process is observed on ferrous minerals. Oxygen present in humid air/rainfall reacts with iron grains in the rocks to form a yellow or red oxide of iron. This is called rusting of the iron. Rust decomposes rocks completely with the passage of time. Hence, Statement III is correct.
Hence, both statement-II and statement-III are correct and both of them explain statement-I**

### Question 13

Consider the following:

1. Cashew

2. Papaya

3. Red sanders

How many of the above trees are actually native to India?

- (a) Only one
- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
Cashew: is an evergreen shrub or tree of the sumac family (Anacardiaceae), cultivated for its characteristically curved edible seeds, which are commonly called cashew “nuts” though they are not true nuts. The domesticated cashew tree is native to the New World but commercially cultivated mainly in Brazil and India.  Hence, option 1 is incorrect.
Papaya: is a succulent fruit of a large plant of the family Caricaceae. Though its origin is rather obscure, the papaya may represent the fusion of two or more species of Carica native to Mexico and Central America. Today it is cultivated throughout the tropical world and into the warmest parts of the subtropics. Hence, option 2 is incorrect.
Red Sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus): is an endemic tree species of the forests of the Seshachalam, Veligonda, Lankamala and Palakona Hills range of Andhra Pradesh. Hence, option 3 is correct.**

### Question 14

With reference to “water vapour”, which of the following statements is/are correct?

1. It is a gas, the amount of which decreases with altitude.

2. Its percentage is maximum at the poles.

Select the answer using the code given below:

- (a)    1 only
- (b)    2 only
- (c)    Both 1 and 2
- (d)    Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
Statement 1 is correct: Water vapour is also a variable gas in the atmosphere, which decreases with altitude. In the warm and wet tropics, it may account for four per cent of the air by volume, while in the dry and cold areas of deserts and polar regions, it may be less than one percent of the air. 
Statement 2 is incorrect: Water vapour decreases from the equator towards the poles because insolation decreases as we move from the tropics to the poles, and due to this, evaporation also decreases, which results in the decrease of vapour in the atmosphere.
It also absorbs parts of the insolation from the sun and preserves the earth’s radiated heat. It, thus, acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot. Water vapour also contributes to the stability and instability of the atmosphere.**

### Question 15

Consider the following description:

Annual and daily range of temperatures is low.

Precipitation occurs throughout the year.

Precipitation varies between 50 cm – 250 cm.

What is this type of climate?

- (a)    Equatorial climate
- (b)    China type climate
- (c)    Humid subtropical climate
- (d)    Marine West coast climate
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Marine West Coast Climate (Cfb)
Marine west coast climate is located poleward from the Mediterranean climate on the west coast of the continents. The main areas are:

Northwestern Europe, 
West coast of North America, 
North of California, 
southern Chile,
southeastern Australia 
New Zealand. 

Due to marine influence, the temperature is moderate and in winter, it is warmer than for its latitude. The mean temperature in summer months ranges from 15°-20°C and in winter 4°-10°C. The annual and daily ranges of temperature are small. Precipitation occurs throughout the year. Precipitation varies greatly from 50-250cm.**

### Question 16

With reference to “Coriolis force”, which of the following statements is/are correct?

1. It increases with increase in wind velocity.

2. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator.

Select the answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Coriolis force is at a right angle to wind direction and directly proportional to wind speed. That is, as wind speed increases, Coriolis force increases. At a given latitude, double the wind speed and you double the Coriolis force. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Why at a given latitude?
Coriolis force varies with latitude from zero at the Equator to a maximum at the poles. It influences wind direction everywhere except immediately at the Equator; but the effects are more pronounced in middle and high latitudes. Hence, statement 2 is correct.**

### Question 18

One of the following regions has the world’s largest tropical peatland, which holds about three years worth of global carbon emissions from fossil fuels; and the possible destruction of which can exert detrimental effect on the global climate.

Which one of the following denotes that region?

- (a) Amazon Basin
- (b) Congo Basin
- (c) Kilkori Basin
- (d) Rio de la Plata Basin
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp:
The Congo Basin is home to the world’s largest tropical peatlands, along with Brazil and Indonesia. The peat swamp forest of the Congo Basin stores around 29 billion tons of carbon – approximately equivalent to three years’ worth of global greenhouse gas emissions – while the Basin as a whole absorbs nearly 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year. The Basin stretches across six countries-  Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.
Peatlands cover only 3 per cent of the global land surface but store an estimated 600 billion tons of carbon- twice as much as in all the world’s forests. This makes them one of the most efficient carbon sink ecosystems and underlines the need to protect them, experts say.**

### Question 5

Which one of the following is the best example of repeated falls in sea level, giving rise to present-day extensive marshland?
(a) Bhitarkanika Mangroves
(b) Marakkanam Salt Pans
(c) Naupada Swamp
(d) Rann of Kutch

Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Option 1 is incorrect: Bhitarkanika mangroves, situated in Odisha, India, represent a noteworthy mangrove ecosystem. Although subject to tidal variations, it has not been created as a result of recurrent decline in sea level. Instead, it has been shaped by the riverine system and recognised as a crucial breeding habitat for diverse species, including
the endangered saltwater crocodile.
Option 2 is incorrect: Marakkanam salt pans, located in Tamil Nadu, are coastal salt marshes utilised for salt production. These pans form in coastal low-lying areas where seawater evaporates, depositing salt crystals. However, it’s essential to note that these salt pans are not a consequence of recurring decline in sea level; rather, these have been established by harnessing existing seawater resources.
Option 3 is incorrect: Naupada Swamp, alternatively referred to as Naupada Wetland, is situated in Andhra Pradesh. Recurrent decreases in sea level have not shaped this freshwater swamp. Rather, it has been created by the influx of freshwater from rivers and seasonal precipitation.
Option 4 is correct: The Great Rann of Kachchh comprises a unique geomorphic entity of the Indian subcontinent. It is a mysterious and fascinating tectonic landscape in an area marked by sea- level changes. Once a shallow extension of the Arabian Sea, the Rann underwent a geological transformation when a shift occurred, disconnecting it from the sea. Over time, this area evolved into a seasonal marshy salt desert. During the monsoon season, it becomes inundated with water, transforming into a wetland. In the summer months, the water recedes, leaving behind a white, salty land bed.**

### Question 6

Ilmenite and rutile, abundantly available in certain coastal tracts of India, are rich sources of which one of the following?
(a) Aluminium

- (b) Copper
- (c) Iron
- (d) Titanium
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Ilmenite (FeTiO3 / FeO.TiO2) and rutile are the most commonly found and abundant minerals of titanium. Ilmenite is weakly magnetic mineral sand, grey-black in colour, solid in form and exists in a triangle crystal structure. Rutile is the most abundant of three naturally occurring forms of titanium dioxide (TiO2; other two forms – anatase; and brookite). It
is reddish-brown and exists in a tetragonal crystal structure. Ilmenite and rutile, being titanium oxide minerals, are used to produce high-performance metal parts such as artificial human body parts, aircraft engine parts, sporting equipment, synthetic rutile, pigments, etc. These pigments are used for whitening in papers, paints, toothpaste, adhesives, plastic and foods and nanotechnologies. India possesses substantial reserves of heavy minerals primarily located along its coastal regions and inland placers. Heavy mineral sands consist of a group of seven minerals: ilmenite, leucoxene (brown ilmenite), rutile, zircon, sillimanite, garnet, and monazite.**

### Question 13

Consider the following statements:
Statement-I: The soil in tropical rain forests is rich in nutrients.
Statement-II: The high temperature and moisture of tropical rain forests cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose quickly.
Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I
(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect
(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
The Earth’s surface predominantly receives its energy in the form of short wavelengths. Short-wave solar radiation largely passes through the atmosphere without significant obstruction. The atmosphere gets heated up through the absorption of long wave radiations emitted by the earth’s surface. Water vapour acts as a strong absorber of infrared radiation. In the lower atmosphere, where water vapour concentration is relatively higher, it absorbs a notable portion of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface.
Option (a) is not correct: Though it is accurate that the equator receives greater direct sunlight in comparison to the poles, the disparity in insolation is not as substantial as tenfold. The variance in insolation between the equator and poles predominantly arises from the curvature of the Earth and the inclination of its axis, causing sunlight to strike different latitudes at varying angles.
Option (b) is not correct: Insolation denotes the entirety of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, encompassing a wide range of electromagnetic radiation. Although infrared radiation constitutes a substantial portion of solar radiation, it does not represent two-thirds of the insolation. Insolation comprises visible light, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and various other wavelengths alongside infrared radiation.
Option (d) is not correct: IR is not part of the visible range. infrared radiation has wavelengths longer than those of visible light and is not perceptible to the human eye.**

### Question 14

Consider the following statements:
Statement-I: The temperature contrast between continents and oceans is greater during summer than in winter.
Statement-II: The specific heat of water is more than that of land surface.
Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?
(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I
(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect
(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct

Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Statement-I is not correct: The tropical rainforest occurs near the equator and close to the tropics. Thus it receives heavy rainfall throughout the year. The heavy rain causes intense leaching of the soil which increases the acidity of the soil. Due to increased acidity, there is an issue of less nutrient absorption from the soil.
Statement-II is correct: As the tropical rainforest lies in a region of heavy rainfall and near to tropics, thus the climate here is hot and humid. This causes the rapid decomposition of the dead organic material present in the soil.
Hence, statement-I is incorrect, but statement-II is correct.**

### Question 15

Consider the following statements:
1. In a seismograph, P waves are recorded earlier than S waves.
2. In P waves, the individual particles vibrate to and fro in the direction of wave propagation, whereas in S waves, the particles vibrate up and down at right angles to the
direction of wave propagation.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
During the summer the temperature on land increases rapidly and in the ocean increases gradually, while in winter the temperature on land falls rapidly while in the oceans it decreases slowly. However the effect is typically less pronounced than the contrast seen in summer due to the overall lower temperatures.
Statement-I is correct: During summer, the temperature disparity between continents and oceans is more pronounced compared to winter.
Statement-II is correct: Specific heat is the amount of heat energy it takes to raise or lower the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1°Celsius. The specific heat of water is greater than that of dry soil, thus, water absorbs and releases heat more slowly than land.
Hence, Both statement-I and statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I**

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: d

## Year: 2022

### Question 1

In the northern hemisphere, the longest day of the year normally occurs in the:

- (a) First half of the month of June
- (b) Second half of the month of June
- (c) First half of the month of July
- (d) Second half of the month of July
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Motion of Earth
Summer Solstice (21st June):

The Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and the rays of the sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer → areas receive more heat.
The longest day and the shortest night at these places occur on 21st June. Thus, the second half of the month of June in the northern hemisphere has the longest day of the year.
Areas near the poles receive less heat as the rays of the sun are slanting.
The North Pole is inclined towards the sun and the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for about six months.
Since a large portion of the Northern Hemisphere is getting light from the sun, it is summer in the regions north of the equator.
Southern Hemisphere: All these conditions are reversed (winter season- longer nights)

### Question 2

Consider the following statements:

1. High clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth.

2. Low clouds have a high absorption of infrared radiation emanating from the Earth’s surface and thus cause a warming effect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Clouds
Statement 1 is incorrect: Low, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth.
Statement 2 is incorrect: High, thin clouds primarily transmit incoming solar radiation. At the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth.

Whether a given cloud will heat or cool the surface depends on several factors, including the cloud’s altitude, its size, and the make-up of the particles that form the cloud.
The components of the Earth system that are important to the radiation budget are the planet’s surface, atmosphere, and clouds.**

The temperature inside the eye of a cyclone is nearly 10°C less than that of the surroundings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 2 only
- (d) 1 and 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Wind Movement
Jet Stream:

The Jet Stream is a geostrophic wind that generally blows from west to east across the upper layers of the troposphere at an altitude of 20,000 to 50,000 feet.
Air masses with different temperatures collide to form jet streams. Thus, the location of the Jet Stream’s formation is normally characterized by surface temperatures.

Statement 1 is not correct: In both the hemispheres, jet streams run from 20 degrees latitude to the poles.
Statement 2 is correct: Only some cyclones develop an eye. The eye is not present in a temperate cyclone since there is not a single location where the winds and precipitation are not present.
Statement 3 is not correct: The tropical cyclone’s eye is the area with the lowest surface pressure and the warmest air above it (in the upper levels). The eye temperature may be 10°C or more above the surrounding air at a height of 12 km, whereas it is only 0–2°C warmer at the surface.**

OMT is measured up to a depth of 26°C isotherm which is 129 metres in the south-western Indian Ocean during January–March.
OMT collected during January–March can be used in assessing whether the amount of rainfall in monsoon will be less or more than a certain long-term mean.

Select the correct using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Oceanography
About Ocean Mean Temperature (OMT):

It is analysed by measuring the ocean thermal energy between January and March, and it is more accurate than SST at forecasting the Indian summer monsoon.
Unlike SST, OMT was able to accurately predict whether the summer monsoon rainfall was greater than or less than the long-term average in 20 of 25 years (80% success rate).
The reason why OMT performs better than SST is because OMT better represents the upper ocean thermal energy And the variations in the upper ocean thermal energy conditions are mainly responsible for the summer monsoon

Statement 1 is incorrect: OMT is measured up to a depth of 26°C isotherm at depths varying from 50-100 meters not 129 meters
Statement 2 is correct: OMC is analyzed by measuring the ocean thermal energy during the January-March period – can better predict Indian summer monsoon than the SST.**

**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Dew Formation/Water in Atmosphere
Option (b) is correct: The dew drops are not formed on a cloudy night because the Clouds reflect back the Earth’s radiation.

Cloud cover prevents radiation from earth surfaces from escaping during cloudy nights. It maintains a high air temperature. Additionally, the moisture won’t condense and turn into dew drops on the grass and leaves. Dew is formed when the air temperature touches the dew point.
Dew point is the temperature at which air becomes saturated with water vapor, causing condensation to form. It is the temperature at which the air would need to be cooled in order for the relative humidity to reach 100%.**

### Question 1

In the South Atlantic and South-Eastern Pacific regions in tropical latitudes, cyclone does not What is the reason?

- (a) Sea surface temperatures are low
- (b) Inter-tropical Convergence Zone seldom occurs
- (c) Coriolis force is too weak
- (d) Absence of land in those regions
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Wind Movement
Option (b) is correct: The absence of cyclones can be demonstrated by the seldom occurance of ITCZ Convergence zone in the south east Pacific and south Atlantic regions. Due to this there is no creation of ideal conditions for Tropical Cyclone, for e.g. instead of low, there is high vertical wind sheer.
Cyclone:

A cyclone is a weather phenomenon characterized by a low-pressure center surrounded by a rotating system of winds that spiral inward.

Classification of Cyclone:

Tropical Cyclone
Extra tropical  cyclone  also  called

Temperate cyclone
Factors Responsible for for Tropical Cyclone Formation:

Warm Ocean Water: Cyclones form over warm ocean water, typically with temperatures of 26 degrees Celsius or higher. This warm water provides the energy that fuels the storm.
Low Atmospheric Pressure: Cyclones form in areas where the atmospheric pressure is low. This creates an area of low pressure that draws in warm, moist air from the surrounding environment.
Coriolis Effect: The Coriolis effect is a phenomenon caused by the rotation of the Earth. It causes air to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This effect is what causes cyclones to spin in a clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.
Humidity: Cyclones require a high level of humidity in order to form. This is because the warm, moist air that is drawn into the low-pressure center of the storm helps to fuel its growth and intensity.**

### Question 2

Consider the following statements:

1. The winds which blow between 30 N and 60 S latitudes throughout the year are known as westerlies.

2. The moist air masses that cause winter rains in North-Western region of India are part of  westerlies

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Wind Movement/Indian Monsoon Option (b) is correct: Generally the westerlies flow between 30° and 60°N and 30° and 60°S
latitude respectively. The moist air masses that
cause winter rains in North-Western region of India are part of westerlies which are also known as winter disturbances.
Westerlies:

The westerlies are the winds blowing from the subtropical high pressure belts towards the sub polar low pressure belts.
The Westerlies play an important role in carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents that is the eastern section of the Oceans in the temperate zone.





Note: In this question, the examiner made a simple but difficult to observe change in latitudes i.e “30 N and 60 S latitudes” to make the statement incorrect. Always read questions carefully and cautiously. Although we read incorrect statements in the exam hall, our mind correlates it to what we have read in the textbook/standard book, making it difficult to identify minor twists and twicks. Earlier, UPSC had asked questions on westerlies in 2011. Revising PYQ and doing peripheral research is always important from prelims perspective.**

- (a) The Earth’s rotation on its axis
- (b) Convergence of the two equatorial currents
- (c) Difference in salinity of water
- (d) Occurrence of the belt of calm near the equator
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Equatorial Counter Currents
Option (a) is incorrect: As the earth rotates from west to east, water near the equator tends to move from east to west (due to the prevailing winds). This leads to the formation of Equatorial currents, both North and South of the equator.
Option (b) is correct: Piling up of water in the western pacific due to the convergence of the North Equatorial Current and South Equatorial Current. This piled up water then flows from west to east, under the effect of gravity, resulting in Counter Equatorial Current (CEC).
Option (c) is incorrect: Difference in salinity of water greatly influences vertical currents and its influence on horizontal movement is less significant.
Option (d) is incorrect: The Doldrums/ Equatorial belt around the Equator are zones of very calm winds, it has little effect on eastward flow of equatorial counter current.**

- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Major Climate of the World
Statement 1 is correct: The tropical rain forest appears from above as a dense canopy of greenery, only disturbed by huge rivers or areas cleared for farming.
Statement 2 is correct: The higher temperatures in the tropics cause higher rates of metabolism, ecological dynamics and coevolutionary processes, which generate and maintain higher biodiversity, which results in the coexistence of a large number of species.
Statement 3 is correct: All plants (most epiphytes) strive upwards for sunshine, resulting in an odd layer structure. Numerous evergreen trees that produce tropical hardwoods like mahogany, ebony, dyewoods, etc. make up the equatorial vegetation.
Natural Vegetation:

High temperature and abundant rainfall support a luxuriant tropical rainforest.
In the Amazon lowlands, the forest is so dense that it is called ‘Selvas’.**

### Question 3

The annual range of temperature in the interior of the continents is high as compared to coastal areas. What is/are the reason/reasons?

Thermal difference between land and water
Variation in altitude between continents and oceans
Presence of strong winds in the interior
Heavy rains in the interior as compared to coasts

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Distribution of the temperature of Earth
Statement 1 is correct: One major factor affecting the distribution of the temperature of Earth is the distribution of Land and Oceans. The loss of heat from the continents is greater than that from the oceans because there is more land in the northern hemisphere and more water in the southern hemisphere, and because the specific heat of land and water differs greatly.
Statement 2 is not correct: The variation in altitude between continents and oceans is not a valid reason for the high annual range of temperature in the interior of the continent as compared to coastal areas. This is because as compared to oceans, the lands heats up and cools down faster.
Statement 3 is not correct: Annual precipitation is usually low in the interior areas as well as the presence of weak winds in the interior.
Statement 4 is not correct: The interiors in Central Asia receive very poor rainfall due to distance from the sea.**

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3
- (c) 1 and 3
- (d) None of the above produces the thunder
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Wind Movement
Statement 1 is not correct: Thunder is the sound caused by a lightning discharge. Lightning heats the air in its path and causes a large over- pressure of the air within its channel. The channel expands supersonically into the surrounding air as a shock wave and creates an acoustic signal that is heard as thunder.
Statement 2 is not correct: The thunderstorms are associated with the cumulonimbus clouds not nimbus.
Statement 3 is not correct: The updraft and downdraft determine the path of the thunderstorm.
Additional Information:

Cumulonimbus clouds are tall and dense, and are often associated with thunderstorms. They can extend up to 10 miles high in the atmosphere and are characterized by a large, anvil-shaped top. Cumulonimbus clouds can produce heavy rain, hail, lightning, and tornadoes.
On the other hand, Nimbus clouds are low-level clouds that typically produce light to moderate rain or snow. They are often found in areas of stable atmospheric conditions and are not typically associated with thunderstorms. Nimbus clouds can appear as a uniform layer of gray or white clouds covering the sky.**

Electromagnetic Radiation: The radiation travels in waves and has electric and magnetic It consists of X-rays, gamma rays, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, radio waves, and microwaves.
Geothermal Energy: The primary driving force behind endogenic geomorphic processes is energy coming from within the ground. The primary sources of this energy are radioactivity, friction caused by tidal and rotational motion, and primordial heat from the earth’s formation.
Gravitational Force: In addition to being a directional force that activates all downward motions of matter, gravity stresses the constituent parts of the earth. Eg: Mass movement, Avalanche.
Plate Movements: Earthquakes and continent building are the results of plate
Rotation of the Earth: The unequal heating of the earth’s surface, which arises from rotation about its axis, creates pressure differences and generates winds.
Revolution of the Earth: Earth rotates in an elliptical orbit around the sun. The term “Aphelion” refers to the period when the distance between the sun and Earth is at its greatest and “Perihelion” to the period when it is at its shortest.
Thus, all of the above are responsible for bringing dynamic changes on the surface of the earth.**

### Question 3

Normally, the temperature decreases with the increase in height from the Earth’s surface, because

1. The atmosphere can be heated upwards only from the Earth’s surface

2. There is more moisture in the upper atmosphere.

3. The air is less dense in the upper atmosphere.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Atmosphere
Statement 1 is correct: Normal lapse rate that is 1-degree Celcius temperature falls at a height of every 165 mt in the troposphere. As we increase elevation, the air pressure decreases as there is less air above us. As the pressure decreases, air molecules spread out further i.e. air expands, and the temperature decreases and the atmosphere can be heated upwards only from the Earth’s surface. Temperature falls off with height at a predictable rate because the air near the surface is heated and becomes light, and the air higher up cools to space and becomes heavy.
Statement 2 is not correct: The water vapour, which accounts for around 1% of air varies greatly in the troposphere and decreases rapidly with altitude.
Statement 3 is correct: The air density in the atmosphere decreases with height and it helps in decreasing temperature.**

- (a) 1, 2 and 3 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Ocean Acidification
Statement 1 is correct: Ocean acidification ecreases the calcifying ability of corals, calcareous plankton, crustaceans etc.
Statement 2 is correct: Ocean acidification will affect corals and this will, in turn, affect one million species that have made corals their homes.
Statement 3 is correct: Coral reefs will erode faster than they can rebuild. When shelled organisms are at risk, the entire food web may also be at risk.
Statement 4 is incorrect: Atmospheric sulfur is produced and emitted by phytoplankton from the ocean in the form of dimethyl sulfide, the increase in ocean acidification led to an adverse impact on phytoplankton development and which led to a low amount of sulfur emission. This will decrease cloud formation in small amounts and not adversely affect indirectly on cloud formation.**

- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Option (d) is correct: The crops which are predominantly rainfed in India are Groundnut, Sesamum and Pearl millets.

Groundnut is a drought-tolerant crop that requires moderate rainfall for its growth and development. Rainfall for cultivation – 500 to 600 mm per annum, distributed rainfall pattern throughout the growing season. Groundnut can withstand a dry spell of 15-20 days during its vegetative stage, but it requires adequate moisture during the flowering and pod formation stages.
Sesamum requires temperature is 25°C to 30°C, can tolerate up to 40°C, sensitive to frost required rainfall is 500-600 mm, its drought-tolerant, excessive rainfall during flowering can cause lower yields . It requires well-drained Soil type, rich in organic matter, pH range of 5 to 8.0.
Pearl millet is a hardy crop that can grow in semi-arid regions. The ideal rainfall for pearl millet cultivation is between 400 to 600 mm per annum, with a well- distributed rainfall pattern throughout the growing season. Pearl millet can tolerate drought conditions and requires moisture during the early growth stages, especially during germination and tillering.
Rainfed areas receive more than 750 mm. Rainfed agriculture is carried out in a wide range of soil types, agro-climatic conditions, and annual rainfall ranges from 400 mm to 1600 mm.

Sub-Theme: Physiography of India
Deep Gorges, U-turn river courses, Parallel mountain ranges and steep gradients causing landslides – all these are representations or characterics of Himalayan youthful topography.
About Himalayan Physiography:

The Himalayas along with other Peninsular mountains are young, weak and flexible in their geological structure unlike the rigid and stable Peninsular Block.
Consequently, they are still subjected to the interplay of exogenic and endogenic forces, resulting in the development of faults, folds and thrust plains.
These mountains are tectonic in origin, dissected by fast-flowing rivers which are in their youthful stage.
In fact the whole mountain system of Himalaya represents a very youthful topography with high peaks, deep V-shaped valleys, gorges, rapids, waterfalls, steep slopes, etc.**

### Question 10

Consider the following statements:

The duration of the monsoon decreases from southern India to northern India.
The amount of annual rainfall in the northern plains of India decreases from east to west.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Indian Monsoon

Monsoon refers to a seasonal change in wind patterns that results in a shift in precipitation patterns over a region. Monsoons occur primarily in tropical and subtropical regions and are characterized by a wet season and a dry season.
During the wet season, the winds bring in warm, moist air from over the oceans, which leads to increased rainfall over the land.
The dry season, on the other hand, is characterized by a shift in wind patterns, which brings in cooler, drier air from over the land, leading to a decrease in rainfall.

Statement 1 is correct: Due to its proximity to the sea, India’s southern region has earlier and longer rainy seasons than its northern region. Rainfall in the northern section of India diminishes as rain-bearing winds cross the western ghats and humidity decreases. The southwest monsoon and the retreating monsoon (northeast monsoon) bring rain to India’s southern region.
Statement 2 is correct: With growing distance from the sea, monsoon rainfall tends to decrease. During the southwest monsoon, Kolkata receives 119 cm, Patna 105 cm, Allahabad 76 cm, and Delhi 56 cm.**

### Question 1

Westerlies in the southern hemisphere are stronger and persistent than in northern hemisphere. Why?

1. Southern hemisphere has less landmass as compared to northern hemisphere.

2. Coriolis force is higher in southern hemisphere as compared to northern hemisphere.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Wind System
Option (a) is correct: The Southern hemisphere has less landmass as compared to the northern hemisphere. The Coriolis force is the same in both hemispheres.
Landmass in both the Hemispheres:

The Northern Hemisphere’s surface is about 40% landmass and is covered by about 60% water in the Northern
The Southern Hemisphere’s surface is about 20% landmass and is covered by 80% water.
Circulating air is deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere as a result of the Earth’s axis of This is known as the Coriolis effect.


The latitude and airspeed have a direct correlation with the amount of deflection the air makes. At the equator, the Coriolis force is zero, while maximum at the poles.**

### Question 3

The jet aircraft fly very easily and smoothly in the lower stratosphere. What could be the appropriate explanation?

1. There are no clouds or water vapour in the lower stratosphere.

2. There are no vertical winds in the lower Stratosphere.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct in this context?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Layers of Atmosphere
Option (c) is correct: The conditions are practically perfect for flying airplanes since this layer is almost completely devoid of clouds and related weather disturbances. So airplanes fly in the lower stratosphere, sometimes in the upper troposphere where weather is calm.

The increase in the temperature with height in the stratosphere makes this region a stable place where the air tends not to overturn vertically. Thus vertical winds are almost absent in Stratosphere


About Stratosphere:

It is located above the troposphere up to 50 km above the surface of the earth.
The thickness of the stratosphere is highest at the poles.**

- (a) The mangrove swamps separate the human settlements from the sea by a wide zone in which people neither live nor venture out
- (b) The mangroves provide both food and medicines which people are in need of after any natural disaster.
- (c) The mangrove trees are tall with dense canopies and serve as an excellent shelter during a cyclone or tsunami
- (d) The mangrove trees do not get uprooted by storms and tides because of their extensive roots.
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Mangroves
Option (d) is correct: because mangroves function as a safety hedge in preserving ecological stability. The dense tangle of roots allows the trees to withstand storms, cyclones or even the daily rise and fall of tides.
Mangroves:

A mangrove is a small tree or shrub that grows along coasts, setting roots in salty sediments, usually beneath water.
Mangrove trees can withstand the tides’ daily rise and fall due to their complex web of roots and extensive roots.**

### Question 5

La Nina is suspected to have caused recent floods in How is La Nina different from El Nino?

1. La Nina is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean whereas El Niño is characterized by unusually warm ocean temperature in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.

2. El Nino has adverse effects on the south-west monsoon of India, but La Niña has no effect on monsoon climate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: El niño & La-nina
Statement 1 is incorrect: La Nina is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific, compared to El Nino, which is characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific.
Statement 2 is incorrect: La Nina causes drought in Peru and Ecuador, heavy floods in Australia, high temperatures in Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, off the Somalian coast, and good monsoon rains in India. El Nino: It occurs more frequently than La Nina. This event is not an usual cycle, they are not predictable and occur irregularly at 2 to 7 year intervals. When the coastal waters become warmer in the eastern tropical Pacific (El Niño) it leads to the decrease of atmospheric pressure above the oceans.**
