### Question 1

How many Delimitation Commissions have been constituted by the Government of India till December 2023?

- (a) One
- (b) Two
- (c) Three
- (d) Four
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Delimitation means the act or process of fixing the limits or boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country having a legislative body. In India, such Delimitation Commissions have been constituted four times – in 1952 under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952, in 1963 under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1962, in 1973 under the Delimitation Act, 1972 and in 2002 under the Delimitation Act, 2002. 
Article 82 and 170 of the Constitution provide that the number of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative assemblies as well as its division into territorial constituencies shall be readjusted after each Census. The ‘Delimitation Commission’ is set up under an act of Parliament. 

The number of seats in the Lok Sabha based on the 1951, 1961 and 1971 Census was fixed at 494, 522 and 543. 
However, it has been frozen as per the 1971 Census in order to encourage population control measures. This was done through the 42nd Amendment Act till the year 2000 and was extended by the 84th Amendment Act till 2026. 
This number will be re-adjusted based on the first Census after 2026. 
The boundaries of territorial constituencies were readjusted (without changing the number of seats) and seats for SC and ST were determined as per the 2001 Census and will again be carried out after 2026.**

### Question 6

Under which of the following Articles of the Constitution of India has the Supreme Court of India placed the Right to Privacy?

- (a) Article 15
- (b) Article 16
- (c) Article 19
- (d) Article 21
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
The Constitution of India does not specifically guarantee a right to privacy. However, through various judgements over the years, the Courts of the country have interpreted the other rights in the Constitution to give rise to a (limited) right to privacy—primarily through Article 21—the right to life and liberty. In 2015, this interpretation was challenged and referred to a larger Bench of the Supreme Court in the writ petition of Justice K.S Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others. The Court, in a landmark judgement on 24 August 2017, unanimously ruled that privacy is a fundamental right and that the right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21), as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. The Bench also ruled that the right to privacy is not absolute but is subject to reasonable restrictions (as is every other fundamental right).**

The Vice President (and Rajya Sabha Chairman) K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House in 1997 to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it. The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel.
Statement 1 is correct:  In the case of Lok Sabha, the Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the 13th Lok Sabha. The late Speaker, G M C Balayogi, constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000, which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Any person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP (Member of Parliament), along with evidence of the alleged misconduct and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not “false, frivolous, or vexatious”. If the Member himself complains, the affidavit is not needed.
Statement 3 is correct: The Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice. The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint.
The Committee presents its report to the Speaker, who asks the House if the report should be taken up for consideration. There is also a provision for a half-hour discussion on the report.**

If the House of the People accepts any of the recommendations of the Council of States, the Money Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses with the amendments recommended by the Council of States and accepted by the House of the People.
If the House of the People does not accept any of the recommendations of the Council of States, the Money Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses in the form in which it was passed by the House of the People without any of the amendments recommended by the Council of States.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

- (a) 1, 2 and 3
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1 and 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Amendment) Bill, 2023 was introduced in Lok Sabha on September 19, 2023.   The Bill seeks to reserve one-third of the total number of seats in Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies for women.
Key features of the Bill



The Bill reserves, as nearly as may be, one-third of all seats for women in Lok Sabha, state legislative assemblies, and the Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.  This will also apply to the seats reserved for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha and state legislatures.  Thus, statement 3 is correct.
The reservation will be effective after the census conducted after the commencement of this Bill has been published.   Based on the census, delimitation will be undertaken to reserve seats for women.  The reservation will be provided for a period of 15 years.   However, it shall continue till such date as determined by a law made by Parliament. Thus, statement 2 is correct.




The next delimitation exercise, or redrawing of constituency boundaries, is scheduled to be held in 2026. Effectively, this means that the earliest implementation of the women’s quota in the Lok Sabha can be in the 2029 general election (19th Lok Sabha), rather than in next year’s polls. Thus, statement 1 is incorrect


Seats reserved for women will be rotated after each delimitation, as determined by a law made by Parliament.**

### Question 13

A Writ of Prohibition is an order issued by the Supreme Court or High Courts to:

- (b) the Parliament/Legislative Assembly to pass a law on Prohibition.
- (c) the lower court prohibiting the continuation of proceedings in a case.
- (d) the Government prohibiting it from following an unconstitutional policy.
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:  
Writs are written orders issued by the Supreme Court (Article 32) or a High Court (Article 226) that direct constitutional remedies for Indian citizens who have been violated of their fundamental rights. There are five kinds of writs: Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo Warranto, and Certiorari.

Habeas Corpus, a Latin term meaning “to produce the body,” is a court order requiring that a detained individual be brought before the court within 24 hours to assess the legality of their detention. If found innocent, the person is released; otherwise, they remain in custody.
Mandamus, a Latin term meaning “command,” is a writ issued by higher courts to ensure public officials fulfill their duties. It cannot be granted against private individuals or companies but is directed at public authorities, companies, tribunals, or lower courts, compelling them to perform their obligations or refrain from specific actions. 
Prohibition is a legal term meaning “to prohibit or restrain.” A higher court issues a writ of prohibition to a lower court to prevent it from exceeding its authority or jurisdiction. This writ applies only to judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, not to administrative agencies, statutory authorities, private individuals, or enterprises. Thus, option C is correct.
Quo warranto means “by what authority.” This writ allows anyone, not just the aggrieved party, to challenge a person’s legal right to hold a public office. It cannot be issued against ministerial offices.
Certiorari, meaning “certified,” is a writ issued by the High Court or Supreme Court to a lower court or tribunal to transfer a case for review or appeal.**

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation

Each House of Parliament has its own presiding officer. There is a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker for the Lok Sabha and a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman for the Rajya Sabha. 
The Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members (as soon as may be, after its first sitting). Whenever the office of the Speaker falls vacant, the Lok Sabha elects another member to fill the vacancy. The date of election of the Speaker is fixed by the President. When a resolution for the removal of the Speaker is under consideration of the House, he cannot preside at the sitting of the House, though he may be present. However, he can speak and take part in the proceedings of the House at such a time and vote in the first instance, though not in the case of an equality of votes.

They (to be pursued further) must be reintroduced in the newly constituted Lok Sabha. However, some pending bills and all pending assurances that are to be examined by the Committee on Government Assurances do not lapse on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. The position with respect to the lapsing of bills is as follows:



A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses (whether it originated in the Lok Sabha or was transmitted to it by the Rajya Sabha). Thus, statement 1 is correct.




A bill passed by the Lok Sabha but pending in the Rajya Sabha lapses. Thus, statement 2 is correct


A bill not passed by the two Houses due to disagreement and if the president has notified the holding of a joint sitting before the dissolution of Lok Sabha, does not lapse. Thus, statement 3 is incorrect.


A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha but not passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse.
A bill passed by both Houses but pending assent of the president does not lapse.
A bill passed by both Houses but returned by the president for reconsideration of Houses does not lapse.**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Within the next few days, the President issues a notification for prorogation of the session. However, the President can also prorogue the House while in session.
Statement 3 is correct: Rajya Sabha, being a permanent House, is not subject to dissolution. Only the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution. Unlike a prorogation, a dissolution ends the very life of the existing House, and a new House is constituted after general elections are held.  Dissolution of the Lok Sabha is done by the President of India, who, save in exceptional circumstances, does so on the advice of the Council of Ministers.**

### Question 1

By which one of the following Acts was the Governor General of Bengal designated as the Governor General of India?
(a) The Regulating Act
(b) The Pitt’s India Act
(c) The Charter Act of 1793
(d) The Charter Act of 1833

Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
About the Charter Act of 1833:

It was the final step towards centralisation in British India.
It made the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General of India and vested in him all civil and military powers (Lord William Bentinck was the first Governor-General of India). Thus, the act created, for the first time, the Government of India having authority over the entire territorial area possessed by the
British in India. Lord William Bentick was the first Governor-General of India.
It deprived the Governors of Bombay and Madras of their legislative powers.
Laws made under the previous acts were called Regulations, while laws made under this act were called Acts.
It ended the activities of the East India Company as a commercial body, which became a purely administrative body.**

### Question 2

In essence, what does ‘Due Process of Law’ mean?
(a) The principle of natural justice
(b) The procedure established by law
(c) Fair application of law
(d) Equality before law

Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
The Doctrine of ‘Due Process of Law’ has its origins in the English Common Law. It was first seen in the Magna Carta-the law of the Land for England. The
due process of law doctrine examines not only whether a law exists to deprive a person of his or her life and personal liberty but also whether the legislation is fair, just, and not arbitrary. Unlike the Procedure established by Law where the judiciary assesses the procedure of the legislation and its competence only,
the Supreme Court, in case of due process of law, analyses the procedure and the rationale of the law. It judges its reasonability.
Indian Context:
Article 21 of the Indian Constitution declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. This right is available to both citizens and noncitizens. In the famous Gopalan case (1950), the Supreme Court had taken a narrow interpretation of Article 21. It held that the protection under Article 21 is available only against arbitrary executive action and not from arbitrary legislative action. This means that the State can deprive the right to life and personal liberty of a person based on a law. This was because of the expression ‘procedure established by law’ in Article 21, which is different from the expression ‘due process of law’ contained in the American Constitution:

Hence, the validity of a law that has prescribed a procedure cannot be questioned on the ground that the law is unreasonable, unfair or unjust.
Secondly, the Supreme Court held that ‘personal liberty’ means only liberty relating to the person or body of the individual.

However, in the Menaka case (1978), the Supreme Court overruled its judgement in the Gopalan case by taking a wider interpretation of Article 21. Therefore, it ruled that the right to life and personal liberty of a person can be deprived by a law provided the procedure prescribed by that law is reasonable, fair and just. In other words, it has introduced the American expression ‘due process of law’:

In effect, the protection under Article 21 should be available not only against arbitrary executive action but also against arbitrary legislative action.
Further, the court held that the ‘right to life’ as embodied in Article 21 is not merely confined to animal existence or survival, but it includes within its ambit the right to live with human dignity and all those aspects of life that go to make a man’s life meaningful, complete and worth living**

### Question 3

Consider the following statements:

day-to-day administration of prisons.
Statement-II: In India, prisons are governed by the Prisons Act, 1894 which expressly kept the subject of prisons in the control of Provincial Governments.
Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?
(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I.
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I.
(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect.
(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct.

Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp: 
Statement 1 is correct: ‘Prisons’/’persons detained therein’ is a “State-List” subject under Entry 4 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Administration and management of prisons and prisoners is the responsibility of respective State Governments who are competent to take appropriate action in this regard. However, given the significance of prisons in the Criminal Justice System, the Ministry of Home Affairs has been providing regular guidance and support to the States and UTs on diverse issues relating to prison administration.
Statement 2 is correct: The Prisons Act, 1894 defines prison as-

 “Prison” means any jail or place used permanently or temporarily under the general or special orders of a State Government for the detention of prisoners, and includes all lands and buildings appurtenant thereto.
Also, Section 59 of the Prisons Act 1894 confers upon the state government powers to make rules consistent with this act.**

Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
About the Constitution of India:

A constitution is a body of basic laws and principles that describes the general organisation and operation of the state and contains fundamental principles and norms that underlie and guide all government action.

It articulates the rights of citizens that institutions, procedures or legislation must not infringe on and which the state must strive to ensure.
Politically, it establishes, distributes and limits governmental power (Chief Purpose of the Constitution) and provides mechanisms for deliberating and deciding on public policy.
Socially, it may reflect a shared identity or civic vision of the state, expressing commonly held values or foundational principles.**

(a) 1st Amendment

- (c) 44th Amendment

**Ans: a
Exp: 

About the Constitution First Amendment Act 1951:
The Constitution First Amendment Act 1951 was to address certain difficulties that had been brought to light by judicial decisions and pronouncements, especially with regard to the chapter on fundamental rights.
The main objects of the First Amendment Act 1951 were:

To amend Article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws in general and certain specified State Acts in particular. (Thus, it was widely believed to be enacted to overcome the judicial interpretations of the Fundamental Rights)
The opportunity was taken to propose a few minor amendments to other articles in order to remove difficulties that may arise.






The story behind the First Amendment:

The justiciability of Fundamental Rights and non-justiciability of Directive Principles, on the one hand, and the moral obligation of the State to implement Directive Principles (Article 37), on the other hand, have led to a conflict between the two since the commencement of the Constitution.
In the Champakam Dorairajan Case (1951), the Supreme Court ruled that in case of any conflict between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles, the former would prevail. It declared that the Directive Principles have to conform to and run as subsidiary to the Fundamental Rights.
But, it also held that Fundamental Rights could be amended by the Parliament by enacting constitutional amendment acts.
As a result, the Parliament made the First Amendment Act (1951), the Fourth Amendment Act (1955) and the Seventeenth Amendment Act (1964) to implement some of the Directives.**

- (a) Article 14
- (b) Article 28
- (c) Article 32
- (d) Article 44
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Rule of Law
A legislation which confers on the executive or administrative authority an unguided and uncontrolled discretionary power in the matter of application of law violates Article 14 of the constitution.
The Article 14 of the Indian Constitution denotes that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. The concept of ‘equality before law’ is an element of the concept of ‘Rule of Law’.
Rule of Law:

The concept of ‘equality before law’ as enshrined in Article 14 of Indian Constitution is taken from the concept of ‘Rule of Law’ propounded by V. Dicey.
Rule of law is a legal principle that states that a country should be ruled by the law rather than by the arbitrary actions of particular government officials.
Rule of law is part of the basic structure of the constitution.

The ‘Rule of Law’ has 3 fundamental principles:

Absence of arbitrary power
Equality before law
Primacy of individual rights

From the above concept we came to know that ‘equality before law’ under Article 14 connotes the absence of arbitrary power with the authorities. Therefore, when a legislation confers uncontrolled discretionary powers on any authority, it tends to violate Article 14 of the constitution.**

Liberty can be seen from two perspectives– negative and positive.

Negative liberty: It is concerned with the inviolable area of non-interference and not with the conditions in society, i.e. absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints.
Positive liberty: Recognizes that one can be free only in society and not outside it, therefore it is the possibility of acting or the fact of acting in such a way as to take control of one’s life and realise one’s fundamental Safeguards of Liberty:
Declaration of rights of the individuals: It is an important safeguard of liberty. In this manner, the government can be prevented from interfering with citizens’ liberty.
The independent and impartial judiciary is aptly referred to as the watchdog of liberty.
Decentralisation of powers: History is witness to the fact that concentration of power has very often led to despotism.
Separation of powers, i.e., the executive, the legislature and the judiciary being separate, is a great ally of liberty. Montesquieu said, “Power should be a check on power.”
Rule of law or equality in the eyes of the law is also an important safeguard of This is the bulwark against discrimination based on caste, class, colour, creed, etc.

Law:

It works as the aggregate of legislation, judicial precedents, and accepted legal principles; the body of authoritative grounds of judicial and administrative action; esp., the body of rules, standards, and principles that the courts of a particular jurisdiction apply in deciding controversies brought before them.

Absence of Restraint does not necessarily imply equality in society as restraining the actions of the society curtails the liberty of the individual.
Absence of Competition in society may result in monopoly, which would not imply equality, rather inequality in the society.
Absence of ideology does not imply equality in society. Ideology is a set of principles or beliefs of a group/institution in the society.**

The Constitution under Article 243P mandates formation of Metropolitan Planning Committees (MPCs) in all metropolitan areas where population is above 10 Lakh. The elected officials of the municipalities and the heads of the panchayats in the metropolitan area elects 2/3rd of the MPC members from among themselves. 1/3rd is nominated. Elected members are proportionate to the rural: urban population ratio.
Statement 2 is correct: MPC prepares the draft development plans for the metropolitan area. Statement 3 is incorrect: MPC helps in draft planning and not in implementing the Govt sponsored schemes in the metropolitan area.



NOTE: In statement 3, after reading the extreme/absolute phrase “sole”, we can take the calculable risk of marking it as incorrect. This logic is also supported by reasoning that MPC is a “planning body” and statement 3 is talking about “implementation functions”.**
