Desert Biome:

Both warm and mid-latitude deserts have a predominance of xerophytic or drought- resistant plants.
This comprises cacti, thorny bushes, wiry grasses with extensive roots, and scatted dwarf acacias.
In order to gather moisture and search for ground water, the majority of desert shrubs have lengthy roots that are widely
Plants with few or no leaves typically have needle-shaped, waxy, leathery, or hairy foliage to reduce water loss through
Many kinds of grasses and herbs have tough, thick skins on their seeds that serve as protection when the plants are dormant.**

- (a) Increased plant growth due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- (b) Increased temperature of Earth due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- (c) Increased acidity of oceans as a result of increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- (d) Adaptation of all living beings on Earth to the climate change brought about by the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
Explanation


**Ans: (a)
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Environment
Carbon fertilisation

It is the artificial enrichment of the atmosphere of greenhouses with carbon dioxide, an essential nutrient for plants and vegetables. It also goes by the name of “Carbon Dioxide Fertilization.”
It is used to raise production levels in order to do so both qualitatively and quantitatively.
It can be used to grow nearly any form of vegetable (asparagus, celery, lettuce, tomatoes, aubergines, etc.), greenhouse fruit (strawberries), and ornamental plants, and is especially suited for cold climates.

Impact on agriculture:

Increase in the photosynthetic rate: It results in an increase in the instantaneous rate of photosynthesis in C3 plants; and increases the transpiration efficiency of the leaf (C3 and C4 plants).
Increases the water use efficiency: During high concentration of carbon dioxide, plants maintain narrow openings of leaf surface which protects them from water loss.
Faster plant growth enhances food production and allows for the sequestration of more carbon dioxide.
Plants distribute a greater proportion of photosynthate to roots under high concentrations of atmospheric carbon
The reproductive biomass growth, as well as vegetative biomass growth, is usually increased by elevated carbon dioxide.**

3. Irrigation over a period of time can contribute to the salinization of some agricultural lands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Environment
Statement 1 is incorrect: Soil water holding capacity is the amount of water that a given soil can hold for crop use. Soil texture and organic matter are the key components that determine soil water holding capacity. Organic matter influences the physical conditions of a soil in several ways.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Sulphur is one of three nutrients that are cycled between the soil, plant matter and the atmosphere. The sulphur cycle describes the movement of sulphur through the atmosphere, mineral and organic forms, and through living things.
Statement 3 is correct: Salinization is a major problem associated with irrigation, because deposits of salts build up in the soil and can reach levels that are harmful to crops.




NOTE: Again, same story!! Carefully observe the extreme keyword ‘drastically’ and ‘any’ in statements 1 and 2 respectively. Not all but most of the time these extreme statements happen to be wrong.**

- (c) 2, 4 and 5
- (d) 1, 2, 3 and 5
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Environment
Conservation Agriculture (CA):

It is a farming system that promotes minimum soil disturbance (i.e. no tillage), maintenance of a permanent soil cover, and diversification of plant species.
It enhances biodiversity and natural biological processes above and below the ground surface, which contribute to increased water and nutrient use efficiency and to improved and sustained crop

According to FAO’s website there are three principles of Conservation of Agriculture:

Minimum mechanical soil disturbance: It refers to low disturbance no-tillage and direct seeding. The disturbed area must be less than 15 cm wide or less than 25% of the cropped area (whichever is lower).
Permanent soil organic cover: Three categories are distinguished: 30-60%, >60- 90% and >90% ground cover, measured immediately after the direct seeding operation. Area with less than 30% cover is not considered as CA.
Species diversification: Rotation/ association should involve at least 3 different crop species. The rotation of crops is not only necessary to offer a diverse “diet” to the soil micro organisms, but as they root at different soil depths, they are capable of exploring different soil layers for**

## Indian Economy

### Question 1

Increase in absolute and per capita real GNP does not connote a higher level of economic development, if:

- (a) Industrial output fails to keep pace with agricultural output.
- (b) Agricultural output fails to keep pace with industrial output.
- (c) Poverty and unemployment increase.
- (d) Imports grow faster than exports.
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Economic Growth
Option (c) is correct: It is possible that an increase in absolute and per capita Gross National Product (GNP) will only reflect the economic growth of a small portion of society, leaving the rest of the population in poverty and unemployment. This is because the concept of per capita real income or per capita GDP are not able to capture the true picture in terms of non-monetary social indicators. Thus, an increase in absolute and per capita real GNP does not connote a higher level of economic development, if poverty and unemployment increase.
Additional Information: Economic Growth and Economic Development:

Economic Growth: A rise in real national income or national output is known as Economic Growth.
Economic Development: It includes raising living standards and the quality of life, as seen in indicators like literacy rates, life expectancy, and access to healthcare.

Economic Development occurs when a country undergoes different economic developments that enhance quality of life, such as a decline in poverty and unemployment, a narrowing of wealth and income disparities, a rise in literacy rates, and improvements in health and sanitation.
An essential aspect of development is to enable the maximum number of people to experience the fruits of development.
This component of progress cannot be captured by ideas of per capita income (per capita GDP or per capita NSDP).
Non-financial social indicators with multiple dimensions are better indicators of a society’s overall economic progress.**

Sub-Theme: Key Words in the Preamble

Where there is no Law, there is no For liberty is to be free from restraint and violence from others, which cannot be where there is no law.
If there are no laws, there is no liberty. Liberty:

Liberty can be seen from two perspectives– negative and positive.

Negative liberty: It is concerned with the inviolable area of non-interference and not with the conditions in society, i.e. absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints.
Positive liberty: Recognizes that one can be free only in society and not outside it, therefore it is the possibility of acting or the fact of acting in such a way as to take control of one’s life and realise one’s fundamental Safeguards of Liberty:
Declaration of rights of the individuals: It is an important safeguard of liberty. In this manner, the government can be prevented from interfering with citizens’ liberty.
The independent and impartial judiciary is aptly referred to as the watchdog of liberty.
Decentralisation of powers: History is witness to the fact that concentration of power has very often led to despotism.
Separation of powers, i.e., the executive, the legislature and the judiciary being separate, is a great ally of liberty. Montesquieu said, “Power should be a check on power.”
Rule of law or equality in the eyes of the law is also an important safeguard of This is the bulwark against discrimination based on caste, class, colour, creed, etc.

Law:

It works as the aggregate of legislation, judicial precedents, and accepted legal principles; the body of authoritative grounds of judicial and administrative action; esp., the body of rules, standards, and principles that the courts of a particular jurisdiction apply in deciding controversies brought before them.

Later, the then Lieutenant Governor of Bihar ordered the withdrawal of the case against Gandhi, and the Collector wrote to Gandhi saying he was free to conduct the inquiry.
In the history of the independence struggle, this tiny step in the form of passive protest was a great leap, signalling the beginning of the Gandhian period.
Leaders associated: Rajendra Prasad, Mazhar-ul-Haq, Mahadeo Desai, Narhari Parekh, J.B. Kripalani etc.
Gandhi’s position in India’s resistance to the British raj was solidified by the victory at Champaran.





NOTE: in given statements, notice “all– India participation” in statement (a) and “Drastic decrease” in statement (d), we can take risk of eliminating these extreme statements. Always remember, there is no set rule for this “extreme word” elimination method. There are also some instances where sentences with extreme words were correct, for instance a question in 2017 about Foreign exchange of India. In the mentioned question, the statement with “drastic increase” was correct.**

### Question 7

In 1920, which of the following changed its name to “Swarajya Sabha”?

- (a) All India Home Rule League
- (b) Hindu Mahasabha
- (c) South Indian Liberal Federation
- (d) The Servants of India Society
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Home Rule League Movement
Home Rule League Movement (1916):

It was an Indian response to World War – I, inspired by Irish Home Rule Leagues.
The movement sought to achieve self-rule through political discussion and education, public gatherings, etc.
The government responded with severe repression, but it prepared masses for Gandhian style of politics.
Tilak launched the Indian Home Rule League in April 1916 at Belgaum.
Annie Besant launched the Home Rule League in September 1916 at Madras.
The All India Home Rule League became Swarajya Sabha in 1920.
Its demands included Swarajya, formation of linguistic states and education in the vernacular.
Leaders: Motilal Nehru, Lala Lajpat Rai, Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai, Chittaranjan Das, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Tej Bahadur Sapru.
Anglo-Indians, most of the Muslims and Non brahmins from south did not join as they felt it would mean home rule of the Hindu majority.**

### Question 8

Regarding Wood’s Dispatch, which of the following statements are true?

Grants-in-Aid system was introduced.
Establishment of universities was recommended.
English as a medium of instruction at all levels of education was recommended.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Reforms in Education during the British Time
Wood’s Dispatch (1854):

Magna Carta of English Education in India.
Government to take up the responsibility for the Education of masses.
Hierarchy of Educational Institutions
Emphasise on       Female,       Vocational Education and teachers’ training.
Secular Education in Government Institutions. 
Grants-in-aid to encourage private education.
Recommended English as the Medium of Instruction in higher studies and vernaculars in school level.
Universities with affiliations in three presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras.

Statement 1 and 2 are correct: Grants-in-aid to encourage private education and affiliating universities in the presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were recommended in the Wood’s Despatch.
Statement 3 is incorrect: The Woods Dispatch recommended English as the Medium of Instruction in higher studies and vernaculars in school level.




NOTE: Grants-in-Aid system and Establishment of universities was very popular recommendations of Woods Dispatch, so option 1 and 2 are correct. However, if you look carefully at option 3, it talks about English as a medium of instruction at all levels of education. Dispatch was in 1854, at that time introducing English as a medium of instruction at all levels sounds unconvincing. By applying this crude logic, and taking the risk of eliminating option 3, we can get the answer.**

### Question 9

Which of the following led to the introduction of English Education in India?

Charter Act of 1813
General Committee of Public Instruction, 1823
Orientalist and Anglicist controversy.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Reforms in Education during the British Time
Statement 1 is correct: The Charter Act of 1813 permitted Christian missionaries to propagate English and preach their religion.
Statement 2 is correct: As a president of the General Committee of Public Instruction, Lord Macaulay wrote a minute, where he Macaulay stressed the implementation of the English language as a medium of instruction through his minute.
Statement 3 is correct: One faction of the Anglicists was in favour of English language as the medium, while the other faction was in favour of Indian languages (vernaculars).
Charter Act of 1813:

The idea of supporting educated Indians and promoting knowledge of contemporary sciences in the country was enshrined into the Charter Act of 1813.
The Act required the Company to yearly approve one lakh rupees for this Even this meagre sum, though, was not made accessible until 1823, mostly due to the disagreement over the most appropriate strategy for this investment.
The Charter Act of 1813 gave Christian missionaries the right to spread the English language and practise their religion.

General Committee on Public Instruction (1823):

A “General Committee of Public Instruction” was established by the Governor-General-in-Council in 1823 with the task of allocating one lakh rupees for educational purposes.
The General Committee of Public Instruction also was not able to decide the medium of instruction by vote; due to lack of majority.
Out of ten members of which Lord Macaulay was the president, five were supporters of English language or Anglicist as the medium of instruction and the rest were supporters of oriental or classic language or Classicists as a medium of instruction.
This is the famous Anglicist and Classicist controversy.
On February 2, 1835, Lord Macaulay, who served as head of the General Committee of Public Instruction, penned a minute in which he stated his position on the issue.
Through his minute, Lord Macaulay emphasised the use of the English language as a medium of instruction. He believed that English was the ideal language for instruction.

Orientalist-Anglicist controversy:




•   Exclusively suggested for spending on modern studies.


 
 
Anglicists opinion
•   Even the Anglicists were divided over the question of medium of instruction, where one faction was for English language as the medium, while the other faction was for Indian languages (vernaculars) for the purpose.


 
 
Orientalists
•   In order to prepare students for careers, Western sciences and literature should be taught, with a focus on advancing traditional Indian education.**

## Science Technology

### Question 1

Consider the following

Birds
Dust blowing
Rain
Wind blowing

Wind blowing Which of the above spread plant diseases?

- (a) 1 and 3 only
- (b) 3 and 4 only
- (c) 1, 2 and 4 only
- (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Plant diseases
Option (d) is correct: Plant disease is an alteration to a plant’s normal state that impairs or changes its essential functioning.

All plant species, both wild and domesticated, are susceptible to illness. Despite the fact that each species is prone to certain diseases, these are always relatively uncommon.
There are many other ways that pathogens that cause plant disease are indirectly transmitted, including by the wind, water, animals, insects, mites, nematodes, birds, and more.
Pathogens can be transferred from one diseased plant to another plant by birds flying through crops.
Wind can carry some plant harmful microorganisms a short way.
Raindrop splashing can spread certain bacteria, as seen in the instance of citrus canker disease.
The illnesses are spread by soil and agricultural activities as well because they cause dust to blow.**

### Question 2

In which of the following areas can GPS technology be used?

Mobile phone operations
Banking operations
Controlling the power grids

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: GPS Technology

A constellation of satellites transmitting navigational signals and a network of ground stations and satellite control stations used for monitoring and control make up the Global Positioning System (GPS), a space- based radio navigation system.
At the moment, 31 GPS satellites are in orbit around the Earth at a height of roughly 11,000 miles, giving users precise information on position, velocity, and time everywhere in the world and in any weather.

Every time and in practically any weather, GPS functions.
As a cooperative civil and military technical programme, the Global Positioning System— previously known as the Navstar Global Positioning System—began in 1973.
While global synchronised time was not the original purpose of GPS, it is today one of its most important features.
Cell tower synchronisation is required by telecom networks in order to pass calls between The clocks in the machinery that regulates current flow in overloaded networks are used by several electrical power grids.
In the Banking Sector ATM, credit card, and high-speed market transactions are timestamped using timing methods derived from GPS.
GPS clocks are used in everything from computer network synchronisation to digital television and radio broadcasting to seismic monitoring and weather reporting using Doppler radar.**

### Question 3

When the alarm of your smartphone rings in the morning, you wake up and tap it to stop the alarm which causes your geyser to be switched on automatically. The smart mirror in your bathroom shows the day’s weather and also indicates the level of water in your overhead After you take some groceries from your refrigerator for making breakfast, it recognises the shortage of stock in it and places an order for the supply of fresh grocery items. When you step out of your house and lock the door, all lights, fans, geysers and AC machines get switched off automatically. On your way to the office, your car warns you about traffic congestion ahead and suggests an alternative route, and if you are late for a meeting, it sends a message to your office accordingly.

In the context of emerging communication technologies, which one of the following terms best applies to the above scenario?

- (a) Border Gateway Protocol
- (b) Internet of Things
- (c) Internet Protocol
- (d) Virtual Private Network
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: AI Technology/New age or modern technology
The Correct answer is Option (b):

Internet of Things: The idea behind the Internet of Things (IoT) is to connect any device to the Internet and other connected devices as long as it has an on/off The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network of interconnected devices and people, all of which gather and exchange information about their environments and how they are used.
VPN: An encrypted connection between a device and a network via the Internet is known as a virtual private network, or Secure transmission of sensitive data is aided by the encrypted connection. It makes it impossible for unauthorised parties to eavesdrop on the traffic and enables remote work for the user. The use of VPN technology is common in business settings.

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): BGP enables data routing, is the protocol that powers the When a user in Singapore loads a website with origin servers in Argentina, BGP is the protocol that enables that communication to happen quickly and efficiently.
BGP is responsible for exploring all of the available paths that data could travel and picking the best route, which usually means hopping between autonomousThe Internet Protocol (IP): It is a protocol, or collection of guidelines, for addressing and routing data packets so they can move between networks and reach their intended The Internet divides data into smaller units known as packets for transmission. Each packet contains IP information, which enables routers to send packets to the appropriate location. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is given an IP address, and data gets to the right place as packets are sent to the IP address associated with them.






NOTE: UPSC could have asked this question in a simple statement, but didn’t do that. The reason behind this long paragraph is to kill precious time and confuse the aspirants. Now if you’re aware and read about AI technology then you could easily pick up the keyword from the above paragraph such as ‘switched on/off automatically’, ‘smart mirror’, ‘traffic alert’, ’sending message automatically’, etc. and answer the question in much less time that too with confidence.**

### Question 4

Consider the following statements:

Light is affected by
The Universe is constantly
Matter warps its surrounding space-time.

Which of the above is/are the prediction/ predictions of Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, often discussed in the media?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Space science

General theory of relativity, is a geometric theory related to gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and currently defines gravitation in modern physics.
A coherent account of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or four- dimensional spacetime, is provided by general relativity, which generalises special relativity and improves Newton’s law of universal gravitation.
In particular, the energy and momentum of all matter and radiation present have a direct relationship to the curvature of spacetime. The Einstein field equations, a set of partial differential equations, define the relationship.
Einstein’s work on special relativity has several ramifications, one of which is that time moves in relation to the Time dilation occurs when an object is in motion, which means that it perceives time more slowly while it is travelling quickly than when it is at rest.
General relativity is a theory of gravity where the fundamental idea is that instead of being an invisible force that attracts objects to one another, gravity is a curving or warping of space.

Statement 1 is correct: An item warps the space around it more dramatically the more large it is. Like a big ball lying on a rubber sheet, the sun, for instance, is large enough to bend space throughout our solar system. Because of this, Earth and the other planets orbit it in bent paths.
Statement 2 is correct: General Theory of Relativity showed that space and time are malleable or flexible, and ever expanding predicted that our universe was ever expanding. The theory of relativity states that massive objects distort spacetime around it. And since photons travel the shortest distance between two points, light appears to be bent when it travels through the distorted spacetime of a massive object.
Statement 3 is correct: An item warps the space around it more dramatically the more large it is. Like a big ball lying on a rubber sheet, the sun, for instance, is large enough to bend space throughout our solar system. Because of this, Earth and the other planets orbit it in bent paths.**

### Question 5

With reference to India’s satellite launch vehicles, consider the following statements:

PSLVs launch the satellite useful for Earth resources monitoring whereas GSLVs are designed mainly to launch communication satellites.
Satellites launched by PSLV appear to remain permanently fixed in the same position in the sky, as viewed from a particular location on Earth.
GSLV Mk III is a four staged launch vehicle with the first and third stages using solid rocket motors; and the second and fourth stages using liquid rocket engines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3
- (c) 1 and 2
- (d) 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Space technology

The satellite-launch vehicles (rockets) created by ISRO are the PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) and GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle). While GSLVs are primarily made to launch communication satellites, PSLVs are meant to launch satellites helpful for monitoring Earth resources.
Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark II (GSLV Mk II) is the largest launch vehicle created by India and currently in use. This three-stage launch vehicle of the fourth generation has four liquid strap- The third stage of the GSLV Mk II is the locally built and flight-tested cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS).
The GSLV Mk III is a three-stage launch vehicle featuring a solid fuel first stage, liquid fuel second stage, and cryogenic technology third stage using liquid hydrogen and liquid
India’s third-generation launch vehicle is the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). It is the first launch vehicle made in India that has liquid With multiple successful missions, PSLV had established itself as India’s dependable and adaptable workhorse launch vehicle after its initial successful launch in October 1994.
Statement 1 is correct: PSLVs launch the satellites useful for Earth resources monitoring whereas GSLVs are designed mainly to launch communication satellites.
Statement 2 is incorrect: GSLV appears to remain permanently fixed in the same position in the sky.
Statement 3 is incorrect: GSLV Mk III is a three-stage launch vehicle with the first stage using solid fuel, the second stage liquid fuel and the third stage cryogenic technology with the use of liquid hydrogen and oxygen.




NOTE: In statement 2, “GSLV” has been replaced by “PSLV” to make statement incorrect and to increase confusion among PSLV and GSLV for aspirants. This is old technique of UPSC to replace one word by another, for instance – Augmented Reality (AR) and Virual Reality (VR). So elimination of statement 2 helps us to reach at 50:50. Stay focus, alert and Calm while reading question/statement.**
