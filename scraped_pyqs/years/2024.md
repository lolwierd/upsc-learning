### Question 3

Consider the following information:

Archaeological Site
State
Description


1.
Chandraketugarh
Odisha
Trading Port town


2.
Inamgaon
Maharashtra
Chalcolithic site


3.
Mangadu
Kerala
Megalithic site

In which of the above rows is the given information correctly matched?

- (a)   1 and 2
- (b)   2 and 3
- (c)   3 and 4
- (d)   1 and 4

**Ans: B**

---

> Explanation:

Pair 1 is incorrectly matched: : Chandraketugarh is an urban centre of the ancient state of Gangaridai belonging to the trans-Bengal region at the interface of West Bengal and Bangladesh. The description has been found from various travelogues from India and abroad. The position of Chandraketugarh has been acknowledged on the basis of Maritime-Land route memoirs and textual historic evidences obtained from within India and also from the eastern and western parts of Asia. The antiquity of the area dates back to eras as early as 4th century BCE, a period much prior to the Mauryan era and shows evidence in the continuity of subsequent Sunga, Kushana, Gupta, Pala and Sena dynasties.

Pair 2 is correctly matched: Inamgaon is a chalcolithic site in Maharashtra. After the disintegration of the Indus civilization, in a phase known as the Early Jorwe (1400– 1000 BC), hundreds of agrarian villages flourished in the Deccan region of west-central India. Environmental degradation, combined with unsustainable agricultural practices, contributed to the abandonment of many communities around 1000 BC. Inamgaon was one of a handful of villages to persist into the Late Jorwe phase (1000–700 BC), wherein reliance on dry-plough agricultural production declined.

Pair 3 is correctly matched : Mangadu is a Megalithic Site in Kerala. The megalithic monuments at Mangadu consisted of 28 hard compact and unhewn laterite blocks within an area of 5 cents of land. The pottery at Mangadu can be classified into three categories namely the huge urns, the medium sized jars are hand made. The associated potteries are of wheel-made pottery and the fabric is black and red and red wares.

Pair 4 is incorrectly matched : Salihundam is a Buddhist Site in Andhra Pradesh as early as the 2nd century CE to the 12th century CE. Here, Buddhism flourished under the patronage of various dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Ikshvakus, and the Eastern Ganga dynasty. The archaeological excavations have revealed numerous stupas, chaityas, viharas and a congregation hall, indicating the importance of this site in the transmission of Buddhist knowledge and wisdom. Rock cut caves are not found in Salihundam.

### Question 4

Who of the following rulers of medieval India gave permission to the Portuguese to build a fort at Bhatkal?

- (a)   Krishnadevaraya
- (b)   Narasimha Saluva
- (c)   Muhammad Shah III
- (d)   Yusuf Adil Shah
Ans : A

> Explanation: Emperor Krishnadevaraya allowed the Portuguese to build a fort Bhatkal in 1510. The town was named Bhatakala after the Jain grammarian Bhattakalanka Deva, who hailed from Haduvalli, 16 km away, capital of the Saluvas of Gerusoppa.

## Art Culture

### Question 1

Which one of the following is a work attributed to playwright Bhasa?

- (a)   Kavyalankara
- (b)   Natyashastra
- (c)   Madhyama-vyayoga
- (d)   Mahabhashya
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Bhasa — one of the earliest Indian playwrights — straddles between two worlds in his celebrated work, Madhyama Vyayoga . He is within the epic and outside of it. Bhasa picks characters from the epic Mahabharatha – Ghatotkacha, Bhima and Hidimba, and weaves it with the story of a Brahmin, taken from a Vedic text. In doing so, Bhasa is creatively liberated from the epic, as also from the Vedic text. This conjunction also makes it possible for Bhasa to gain an interpretive freedom: he thereby bestows upon these epic figures, a new dimension. Ghatokacha is not a cruel demon and Brahmin hater as he is in the epic, Hidimba is no mere mountain of strength and a brutal demoness, and Bhima is not all show of strength**

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   Only three
- (d)   All four
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp: 
List of properties included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site ,2023 are: 

Santiniketan, a town located in West Bengal’s Birbhum district, set up by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore on September 17, 2023 made it to the UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Santiniketan which means ‘abode of peace’ started taking shape in 1901, and it was this place Tagore later put up the foundations of Visva Bharati University. 
Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysalas: This serial property encompasses the three most representative examples of Hoysala-style temple complexes in southern India, dating from the 12th to 13th centuries. The shrines are characterized by hyper-real sculptures and stone carvings that cover the entire architectural surface, a circumambulatory platform, a large-scale sculptural gallery, a multi-tiered frieze, and sculptures of the Sala legend. This was included in UNESCO WHS list in 2023.

Other sites: 

Rani-ki-Vav : on the banks of the Saraswati River, was initially built as a memorial to a king in the 11th century AD. Stepwells are a distinctive form of subterranean water resource and storage systems on the Indian subcontinent, and have been constructed since the 3rd millennium BC. It was included in UNESCO WHS list in 2014
Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodhgaya: It is one of the four holy sites related to the life of the Lord Buddha, and particularly to the attainment of Enlightenment. The first temple was built by Emperor Asoka in the 3rd century B.C., and the present temple dates from the 5th or 6th centuries. It is one of the earliest Buddhist temples built entirely in brick, still standing in India, from the late Gupta period. It was included in UNESCO WHS list in 2002.**

### Question 3

Consider the following statements:

1. There are no parables in Upanishads.

2. Upanishads were composed earlier than the Puranas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a)   1 only
- (b)   2 only
- (c)   Both 1 and 2
- (d)   Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp: 
Statement 1 is not correct: A parable is a succinct, didactic story, in prose or verse, that illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. There are parables in the Upanishads such as  Yama – Nachiketa (Katha Upanishad).
Statement  2 is correct:   There are four Vedas: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda. The Rig Veda is the oldest. The time period during which the Rig Veda is supposed to have been composed isfrom 1500 BCE to 1000 BCE. It has 10 mandalas or books. Some sections of the Rig Veda are older and some are later. For example, books I, VIII, IX and X are later than books II-VII. Sama, Yajur and Atharva Veda along with the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads (1000-500 BCE) constitute Later Vedic literature. While the The itihasa-purana tradition was finally compiled in the form of the Puranas in the mid-first millennium CE (~). It recorded history to the extent that it represents a transition from embedded to externalised history. It has links to the bardic tradition where suta and Magadha were its earliest authors.**

## Environment Ecology

### Question 1

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which one of the following is the largest source of sulphur dioxide emissions?

- (a) Locomotives using fossil fuels
- (b) Ships using fossil fuels
- (c) Extraction of metals from ores
- (d) Power plants using fossil fuels
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Emissions that lead to high concentrations of SO2 generally also lead to the formation of other SOx. The largest sources of SO2 emissions are from fossil fuel combustion at power plants and other industrial facilities. EPA’s national ambient air quality standards for SO2 are designed to protect against exposure to the entire group of sulfur oxides (SOx).  SO2 is the component of greatest concern and is used as the indicator for the larger group of gaseous sulfur oxides (SOx).  Other gaseous SOx (such as SO3) are found in the atmosphere at concentrations much lower than SO2.**

### Question 2

Consider the following statements:

Statement I: India does not import apples from the United States of America.

Statement II: In India, the law prohibits the import of Genetically Modified food without the approval of the competent authority.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I.
- (b)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I.
- (c)   Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect.
- (d)   Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct.
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Statement-I is Incorrect:  Apples are one of the major imports from the USA. After India removed “retaliatory import duty” on US apples in September, imports of American apples have surged 40 times in three months, while traders are hopeful of regaining market share. In 2017-18, the import of US apples was a record of over 7 million boxes, which dropped to 50,000 boxes in the 2022–23.
Statement-II is correct: In India, the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, prohibits import, manufacture, use or sale of GM food without FSSAI’s approval.**

### Question 3

The organisms “Cicada, Froghopper, and Pond skater” are :

- (a)   Birds
- (b)   Fish
- (c)   Insects
- (d)   Reptiles
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
“Cicada, Froghopper, and Pond Skater” comes under the category of Insects. 
Cicada: Cicada is a family of more than 3,000 species of sound-producing insects. They are found in tropical and temperate areas worldwide and occur in deserts, grasslands, and forests. Cicadas have long been used in folk medicines, as religious and monetary symbols, and as an important source of food for humans and many other organisms.
Froghopper: Froghopper are species of small hopping insects which are worldwide in distribution and they produce a frothy substance known as spittle. The whitish nymph secretes a fluid through the anus that is mixed with a secretion from the abdominal glands. Air bubbles are introduced through a special valve on the abdomen to create a spittle that protects the larva from enemies and desiccation.
Pond Skater: Pond skaters are a truly remarkable group of insects that have evolved unique adaptations to thrive in aquatic environments. These small creatures, also known as water striders, can be found gliding effortlessly across the surface of ponds, lakes, and even slow-moving streams.**

### Question 4

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: Many chewing gums found in the market are a source of environmental pollution.

Statement-II: Many chewing gums contain plastic as gum base.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I
- (c)   Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect
- (d)   Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
 Chewing gum is known for its stress-relieving qualities as well as its ability to keep our mouths fresh. Soon, ‘chewing gum’ will be included as part of the drug delivery mechanism. Unfortunately, it has had some negative consequences. Modern chewing gum is made of non-biodegradable hydrophobic polymers together with artificial sweeteners and flavours. So, chewing this sort of synthetic material over a long time could produce some adverse effects. Each year, chewing gum generates more than 105 tonnes of “plastic” garbage. Thus, the discarded non-biodegradable residue of the gum produces plastic pollution. Every year, enormous sums of money are spent to clean up the abandoned gum from the streets. Again, it has a high potential to trap bacteria inside. Therefore, this widespread habit causes an additional nuisance in this pandemic situation.  Hence,  Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I**

### Question 5

Consider the following pairs:

Country
Animal found in its natural habitat


1.
Brazil
Indri


2.
Indonesia
Elk


3.
Madagascar
Bonobo

How many of the pairs given above are correctly matched?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   All three
- (d)   None
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Pair 1 is incorrectly matched: The Indri is endemic to the island country of Madagascar, specifically inhabiting the eastern rainforests. The unique geographical features and climate of Madagascar have facilitated the evolution of numerous species found nowhere else on Earth, including the Indri.
Pair 2 is incorrectly matched: Elk is the largest and most advanced subspecies of red deer, found in North America and in the high mountains of Central Asia. It is a member of the deer family. Recent genetic studies suggest that the “red deer” may have three species:

European red deer.
Tibetan–West Chinese red deer.
Elk.

Pair 3 is incorrectly matched: Bonobos and chimpanzees look very similar and both share 98.7% of their DNA with humans—making the two species our closest living relatives. Bonobos are usually a bit smaller, leaner, and darker than chimpanzees. They are found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Their discontinuous range extends from the Lualaba River in the east to the Kasai/Sankuru Rivers in the south and as far as the Congo River in the west and around Lake Tumba/Lake Mai-Ndombe.**

### Question 6

Consider the following statements :

1. Lions do not have a particular breeding season.

2. Unlike most other big cats, cheetahs do not roar.

3. Unlike male lions, male leopards do not proclaim their territory by scent marking.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp: 
Statement 1 is correct: Both Males and Females of the Lions are polygamous and breed throughout the year, but females are usually restricted to one or two adult males of their pride. In captivity, lions often breed every year, but in the wild, they usually breed no more than once in two years. Females are receptive to mating for three or four days within a widely variable reproductive cycle.
Statement 2 is correctly matched: There are four big cats that can roar: lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar – all of which belong to the genus Panthera. In these species, the epihyal bone, part of the voice box, is replaced by a ligament. This can be stretched, creating a larger sound-producing passage and thus a wider range of pitch. The bones of the cheetah’s voice box form a fixed structure, with divided vocal cords that vibrate with both in and out breaths. This structure is the same for all the ‘small’ cats. While this design enables these cats to purr continuously, it limits the range of other sounds and prevents them from being able to roar.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Leopards are known for their solitary nature and impressive hunting abilities. They are skilled predators that primarily hunt at night, using their incredible agility and stealth to catch a variety of prey. Their diet includes bugs, fish, antelope, monkeys, rodents, and more. Leopards are considered opportunistic hunters, adapting and targeting different species based on availability and their specific habitat. To avoid competition and conflicts, leopards establish their own territories, marking them with scent and claw marks on trees. Male leopards will fiercely defend their territories if they overlap with other males.**

How many of the above are considered “Distributed Energy Resources”?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   Only three
- (d)   All four
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Distributed energy resources, or DER, are small-scale energy systems that power a nearby location. DER can be connected to electric grids or isolated, with energy flowing only to specific sites or functions. DER include both energy generation technologies and energy storage systems. When energy generation occurs through distributed energy resources, it is referred to as distributed generation. Examples of distributed energy resources that can be installed include:

Roof top solar photovoltaic units




Wind generating units




Battery storage




Batteries in electric vehicles used to export power back to the grid
Combined heat and power units, or tri-generation units that also utilise waste heat to provide cooling
Biomass generators, which are fuelled with waste gas or industrial and agricultural by-products.

### Question 8

Which one of the following shows a unique relationship with an insect that has coevolved with it and that is the only insect that can pollinate this tree?

- (a)   Fig
- (b)   Mahua
- (c)   Sandalwood
- (d)   Silk cotton
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
The banyan fig tree Ficus microcarpa is famous for its aerial roots, which sprout from branches and eventually reach the soil. Aerial roots are roots above the ground that are found in diverse plant species like mangroves, banyan figs and orchids. The tree also has a unique relationship with a wasp that has coevolved with it and is the only insect that can pollinate it. Figs are known to sustain at least 1,200 bird and mammal species.  Fig trees were among the earliest domesticated crops and appear as sacred symbols in Hinduism, Buddhism and other spiritual traditions.**

---

### Question 9

Consider the following:

1. Butterflies

2. Fish

3. Frogs

How many of the above have poisonous species among them?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   All three
- (d)   None
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Butterflies: Hybrid Heliconius butterflies are Poisonous in nature. In nature, these butterflies are rare. Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno are both highly poisonous, having evolved to produce their own cyanide, and predators have learned exactly what both of these toxic insects look like. 
Fish: “Venomous” fish are those that can inject their toxic venom into victims, whereas “poisonous” fish are those that cause toxic symptoms only if they are eaten. For example: Lionfish, red-bellied piranha etc. 
Frogs: Frogs are amphibians which can survive both on land and water. Some of them can be poisonous also. Poison dart frogs are small, brightly colored amphibians that live on tropical rainforest floors across Central and South America. Poison dart frogs are named for the toxins they secrete from their skin, which have traditionally been used to tips of hunters’ weapons. For example, the Emberá and Noanamá Indigenous people in western Colombia have used the skin of golden poison frogs (Phyllobates terribilis) to tip blowgun darts for hundreds of years.**

### Question 10

With reference to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that are used in making many consumer products, consider the following statements:

1. PFAS are found to be widespread in drinking water, food and food packaging materials.

2. PFAS are not easily degraded in the environment.

3. Persistent exposure to PFAS can lead to bioaccumulation in animal bodies.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

- (a)   1 and 2 only
- (b)   2 and 3 only
- (c)   1 and 3 only
- (d)   1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products around the world since about the 1950s. 

People are most likely exposed to these chemicals by consuming PFAS-contaminated water or food, using products made with PFAS, or breathing air containing PFAS. Although PFOS use has been phased out, it can still be found in drinking water, groundwater, soil, and air. Hence, Statement 1 is correct.
PFAS molecules have a chain of linked carbon and fluorine atoms. Because the carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest, these chemicals do not degrade easily in the environment. Hence, Statement 2 is correct.
People may encounter different PFAS chemicals in various ways. Over time, people may take in more of the chemicals than they excrete, a process that leads to bioaccumulation in bodies. Hence, Statement 3 is correct.**

---

### Question 11

Consider the following:

1. Carabid beetles

2. Centipedes

3. Flies

4. Termites

5. Wasps

Parasitoid species are found in how many of the above kind of organisms?

- (a)   Only two
- (b)   Only three
- (c)   Only four
- (d)   All five
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Many animals are predators, parasites or parasitoids, using other animals as food. They use a great diversity of hunting strategies and behaviours to capture or feed on their prey. Invertebrate predators, parasites and parasitoids play an important role in keeping many animal populations under control.

Parasitoid is an insect whose larvae feed and develop within or on the bodies of other arthropods. Each parasitoid larva develops on a single individual and eventually kills that host. Most parasitoids are wasps, but some flies and a small number of beetles (carabid bettles), moths, lacewings, and even one caddisfly species have evolved to be parasitoids. Parasitoids alone number about 68,000 named species, and most have yet to be named and described. Realistic estimates of the total number of described and undescribed parasitoid species are about 800,000.
Predator: They are organisms that captures and eats another (the prey). This act is called predation. The predatory invertebrates include scorpions, centipedes, predatory mites, predatory snails and slugs, nematodes and planarian worms
Detritivores: Termites are detritivores that eat dead and decaying organic matter like logs of wood in a forest. They form an important link in the cycling of nutrients in the forests by breaking down wood and organic residues on the ground**

### Question 12

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: The Indian Flying Fox is placed under the “vermin” category in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

Statement-II: The Indian Flying Fox feeds on the blood of other animals.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I
- (c)   Statement -I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect
- (d)   Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Statement 1 is correct: The Indian Flying Fox is placed under the “vermin” category in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 due to its destructive tendencies towards fruit farms.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Bats are the only flying mammals in the world, and the Indian Flying Fox is one of the largest. The species, Pteropus giganteus , also called the Great Indian Fruit Bat, it eats fruits, feeding on the juice, and helps in seed dispersion and pollination, making them an integral part of the ecosystem.**

### Question 13

Consider the following materials:

1. Agricultural residues

2. Corn grain

3. Wastewater treatment sludge

4. Wood mill waste

Which of the above can be used as feedstock for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

- (a)   1 and 2 only
- (b)   2 and 4 only
- (c)   1, 2, 3 and 4
- (d)   1, 3 and 4 only
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen and electric all have a role to play in the decarbonization of aviation. SAF is vitally important as it can address decarbonization of fuel over its lifecycle, and this is now available to be used in all turbine engines including in mid and long-range aircraft. Therefore, understanding the feedstock landscape as well as the technology pathways is integral to maximising the production and supply of SAF. The production of SAF starts with one of five main families of raw materials: 

Corn grain




Oil seeds
Algae
Other fats, oils, and greases




Agricultural residues




Forestry residues




Wood mill waste




Municipal solid waste streams




Wet wastes (manures, wastewater treatment sludge)


Dedicated energy crops.**

The longest border between any two countries in the world is between:

- (a)   Canada and the United States of America
- (b)   Chile and Argentina
- (c)   China and India
- (d)   Kazakhstan and Russian Federation
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
Canada shares the longest international land border with the United States. The Canada-US land border is 8,893 km long. The border is divided into two: the border shared with Canada by the continental United States and the border that the state of Alaska shares with northern Canada. Eight Canadian provinces and thirteen American states run along the shared boundary.**

### Question 2

Consider the following statements:

1. The Red Sea receives very little precipitation in any form.

2. No water enters the Red Sea from rivers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Red Sea is a narrow strip of water extending southeastward from Suez, Egypt, for about 1,200 miles (1,930 km) to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects with the Gulf of Aden and thence with the Arabian Sea.
Climate:
The Red Sea region receives very little precipitation in any form, although prehistoric artifacts indicate that there were periods with greater amounts of rainfall. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Hydrology:
No water enters the Red Sea from rivers, and rainfall is scant, but the evaporation loss – in excess of 80 inches per year – is made up by an inflow through the eastern channel of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait from the Gulf of Aden. Hence, statement 2 is correct.**

---

### Question 3

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: The atmosphere is heated more by incoming solar radiation than by terrestrial radiation.

Statement-II: Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are good absorbers of long wave radiation.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I
- (c) Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect
- (d)  Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Statement-I is incorrect: Insolation reaches the earth’s surface in short waves and heat is radiated from the earth in long waves. The atmosphere is transparent to short waves and opaque to long waves. Hence, energy leaving the earth’s surface i.e. terrestrial radiation, heats up the atmosphere more than the incoming solar radiation i.e. insolation.
Statement-II is correct: The long-wave radiation is absorbed by atmospheric gases, particularly by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the Earth’s radiation.
Hence, statement-I is incorrect, but statement-II is correct.**

---

### Question 4

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: Thickness of the troposphere at the equator is much greater as compared to poles.

Statement-II: At the equator, heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explains Statement-I
- (c)   Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect
- (d)   Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct.
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
The troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere. Its average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
The thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents. This layer contains dust particles and water vapour. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Changes in climate and weather take place in the troposphere. This includes changes in atmospheric concentration of various gases, temperature and humidity, etc.
Hence, both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I.**

### Question 5

Consider the following:

1. Pyroclastic debris

2.  Ash and dust

3.  Nitrogen compounds

4 . Sulphur compounds

How many of the above are products of volcanic eruptions?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   Only three
- (d)   All four
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
A volcano is a place where gases, ashes and/or molten rock material – lava – escape to the ground. A volcano is called an active volcano if the materials mentioned are being released or have been released in the recent past.
Statement 1 is correct: The mantle contains a weaker zone called the asthenosphere. From this, the molten rock materials find their way to the surface. The material in the upper mantle portion is called magma. Once it starts moving towards the crust or reaches the surface, it is called lava. The material that reaches the ground includes: 

lava flows 


pyroclastic debris




volcanic bombs




ash and dust 




gases such as- 




nitrogen compounds


sulphur compounds 




minor amounts of chlorine, hydrogen and argon etc.**

### Question 6

Which of the following is/are correct inference/inferences from isothermal maps in the month of January?

1. The isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent.

2. The presence of cold ocean currents, Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift make the North Atlantic Ocean colder and the isotherms bend towards the north.

Select the answer using the code given below:

- (a)    1 only
- (b)    2 only
- (c)    Both 1 and 2
- (d)    Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: a
 Exp:
Statement 1 is correct: In the northern hemisphere, the land surface area is much larger than in the southern hemisphere. Hence, the effects of land mass and ocean currents are well-pronounced. The isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent. 
The effect of the ocean is well pronounced in the southern hemisphere. Here, the isotherms are more or less parallel to the latitudes, and the variation in temperature is more gradual than in the northern hemisphere.
Statement 2 is incorrect: North Atlantic Drift Current is part of a clockwise-setting ocean-current system in the North Atlantic Ocean, extending from southeast of the Grand Bank, off Newfoundland, Canada, to the Norwegian Sea, off northwestern Europe. It constitutes the northeastward extension of the Gulf Stream and is characterized by warm temperatures and high salinity.

### Question 9

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: Rainfall is one of the reasons for the weathering of rocks.

Statement-II: Rain water contains carbon dioxide in solution.

Statement-III: Rain water contains atmospheric oxygen.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)    Both Statement-II and Statement-III are correct and both of them explain Statement-I
- (b)    Both Statement-II and Statement-III are correct, but only one of them explains Statement-I
- (c)    Only one of the Statement II and III is correct and that explains Statement-I
- (d)    Neither Statement-II nor Statement-III is correct
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
Chemical weathering describes the process of chemicals in rainwater making changes to the minerals in a rock. Hence, Statement I is correct.
Carbon dioxide from the air is dissolved in rainwater, making it slightly acidic. A reaction can occur when the rainwater comes into contact with minerals in the rock, causing weathering. Hence, Statement II is correct.
Oxidation: This is the process in which atmospheric oxygen reacts with the rock to produce oxides. The process is called oxidation. The greatest impact of this process is observed on ferrous minerals. Oxygen present in humid air/rainfall reacts with iron grains in the rocks to form a yellow or red oxide of iron. This is called rusting of the iron. Rust decomposes rocks completely with the passage of time. Hence, Statement III is correct.
Hence, both statement-II and statement-III are correct and both of them explain statement-I**

- (a) Only one
- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
Cashew: is an evergreen shrub or tree of the sumac family (Anacardiaceae), cultivated for its characteristically curved edible seeds, which are commonly called cashew “nuts” though they are not true nuts. The domesticated cashew tree is native to the New World but commercially cultivated mainly in Brazil and India.  Hence, option 1 is incorrect.
Papaya: is a succulent fruit of a large plant of the family Caricaceae. Though its origin is rather obscure, the papaya may represent the fusion of two or more species of Carica native to Mexico and Central America. Today it is cultivated throughout the tropical world and into the warmest parts of the subtropics. Hence, option 2 is incorrect.
Red Sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus): is an endemic tree species of the forests of the Seshachalam, Veligonda, Lankamala and Palakona Hills range of Andhra Pradesh. Hence, option 3 is correct.**

### Question 14

With reference to “water vapour”, which of the following statements is/are correct?

1. It is a gas, the amount of which decreases with altitude.

2. Its percentage is maximum at the poles.

Select the answer using the code given below:

- (a)    1 only
- (b)    2 only
- (c)    Both 1 and 2
- (d)    Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
Statement 1 is correct: Water vapour is also a variable gas in the atmosphere, which decreases with altitude. In the warm and wet tropics, it may account for four per cent of the air by volume, while in the dry and cold areas of deserts and polar regions, it may be less than one percent of the air. 
Statement 2 is incorrect: Water vapour decreases from the equator towards the poles because insolation decreases as we move from the tropics to the poles, and due to this, evaporation also decreases, which results in the decrease of vapour in the atmosphere.
It also absorbs parts of the insolation from the sun and preserves the earth’s radiated heat. It, thus, acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot. Water vapour also contributes to the stability and instability of the atmosphere.**

### Question 16

With reference to “Coriolis force”, which of the following statements is/are correct?

1. It increases with increase in wind velocity.

2. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator.

Select the answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Coriolis force is at a right angle to wind direction and directly proportional to wind speed. That is, as wind speed increases, Coriolis force increases. At a given latitude, double the wind speed and you double the Coriolis force. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Why at a given latitude?
Coriolis force varies with latitude from zero at the Equator to a maximum at the poles. It influences wind direction everywhere except immediately at the Equator; but the effects are more pronounced in middle and high latitudes. Hence, statement 2 is correct.**

### Question 18

One of the following regions has the world’s largest tropical peatland, which holds about three years worth of global carbon emissions from fossil fuels; and the possible destruction of which can exert detrimental effect on the global climate.

Which one of the following denotes that region?

- (a) Amazon Basin
- (b) Congo Basin
- (c) Kilkori Basin
- (d) Rio de la Plata Basin
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp:
The Congo Basin is home to the world’s largest tropical peatlands, along with Brazil and Indonesia. The peat swamp forest of the Congo Basin stores around 29 billion tons of carbon – approximately equivalent to three years’ worth of global greenhouse gas emissions – while the Basin as a whole absorbs nearly 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year. The Basin stretches across six countries-  Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.
Peatlands cover only 3 per cent of the global land surface but store an estimated 600 billion tons of carbon- twice as much as in all the world’s forests. This makes them one of the most efficient carbon sink ecosystems and underlines the need to protect them, experts say.**

### Question 8

With reference to the sectors of the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:

Economic activity
Sector


1.
Storage of agricultural produce
Secondary


2.
Dairy farm
Primary


3.
Mineral exploration
Tertiary


4.
Weaving cloth
Secondary

How many of the pairs given above are correctly matched?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   Only three
- (d)   All four
Explanation


**Ans:  b
Exp:  

Primary : It forms the base for all other products that we subsequently make. Since most of the natural products we get are from agriculture, dairy, fishing, forestry, this sector is also called agriculture and related sector. Ex: Dairy farm
Secondary : It covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. It is the next step after primary. The product is not produced by nature but has to be made and therefore some process of manufacturing is essential. This could be in a factory, a workshop or at home.  For example, using cotton fibre from the plant, we spin yarn and weave cloth. Using sugarcane as a raw material, we make sugar or gur.
Tertiary :  These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns (i.e. Storage of Agriculture produce).
Quaternary: Mineral Exploration**

**Ans: b
Exp: 
Physical capital refers to tangible assets made by humans that a corporation buys or invests in and then uses to produce finished goods or services. It is one of the three factors of production together with land or natural resources and labor or human resources, involving physical assets, such as machines, cars, computers, buildings, etc. it is of two types:

Fixed Capital :  Fixed capital can be thought of as physical investments in producing a good that can be used on several occasions or at least multiple accounting periods. Since it is fixed and reusable (e.g., buildings and machinery), it cannot readily be converted to cash. Although it is not consumed during the manufacturing process, it has a long-term value that can fluctuate and, in most cases, deteriorate with time. For example: Farmers Plough and Computer.
Working Capital:  Working capital refers to a company’s liquid assets, such as cash and inventory in hand, or anything that can be swiftly changed into currency. This type of capital is used during the production of the final product. For example: Yarn used by the weaver and Petrol.**

Accordingly, scheduled commercial banks are required to include in their net demand and time liability (NDTL), the borrowing under CBLO. However, in order to develop CBLO as a money market instrument, it has been decided to grant banks a special exemption from CRR prescription subject to the bank maintaining statutory minimum CRR of 3%;.**

- (c) Three
- (d) Four
Explanation


**Ans: d

- (a) Article 15
- (b) Article 16
- (c) Article 19
- (d) Article 21
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
The Constitution of India does not specifically guarantee a right to privacy. However, through various judgements over the years, the Courts of the country have interpreted the other rights in the Constitution to give rise to a (limited) right to privacy—primarily through Article 21—the right to life and liberty. In 2015, this interpretation was challenged and referred to a larger Bench of the Supreme Court in the writ petition of Justice K.S Puttaswamy & Another vs. Union of India and Others. The Court, in a landmark judgement on 24 August 2017, unanimously ruled that privacy is a fundamental right and that the right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21), as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. The Bench also ruled that the right to privacy is not absolute but is subject to reasonable restrictions (as is every other fundamental right).**

The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel.

- (a) 1, 2 and 3
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1 and 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Eighth Amendment) Bill, 2023 was introduced in Lok Sabha on September 19, 2023.   The Bill seeks to reserve one-third of the total number of seats in Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies for women.
Key features of the Bill



The Bill reserves, as nearly as may be, one-third of all seats for women in Lok Sabha, state legislative assemblies, and the Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.  This will also apply to the seats reserved for SCs and STs in Lok Sabha and state legislatures.  Thus, statement 3 is correct.
The reservation will be effective after the census conducted after the commencement of this Bill has been published.   Based on the census, delimitation will be undertaken to reserve seats for women.  The reservation will be provided for a period of 15 years.   However, it shall continue till such date as determined by a law made by Parliament. Thus, statement 2 is correct.




The next delimitation exercise, or redrawing of constituency boundaries, is scheduled to be held in 2026. Effectively, this means that the earliest implementation of the women’s quota in the Lok Sabha can be in the 2029 general election (19th Lok Sabha), rather than in next year’s polls. Thus, statement 1 is incorrect


Seats reserved for women will be rotated after each delimitation, as determined by a law made by Parliament.**

### Question 13

- (b) the Parliament/Legislative Assembly to pass a law on Prohibition.
- (c) the lower court prohibiting the continuation of proceedings in a case.
- (d) the Government prohibiting it from following an unconstitutional policy.
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:  
Writs are written orders issued by the Supreme Court (Article 32) or a High Court (Article 226) that direct constitutional remedies for Indian citizens who have been violated of their fundamental rights. There are five kinds of writs: Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo Warranto, and Certiorari.

Habeas Corpus, a Latin term meaning “to produce the body,” is a court order requiring that a detained individual be brought before the court within 24 hours to assess the legality of their detention. If found innocent, the person is released; otherwise, they remain in custody.
Mandamus, a Latin term meaning “command,” is a writ issued by higher courts to ensure public officials fulfill their duties. It cannot be granted against private individuals or companies but is directed at public authorities, companies, tribunals, or lower courts, compelling them to perform their obligations or refrain from specific actions. 
Prohibition is a legal term meaning “to prohibit or restrain.” A higher court issues a writ of prohibition to a lower court to prevent it from exceeding its authority or jurisdiction. This writ applies only to judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, not to administrative agencies, statutory authorities, private individuals, or enterprises. Thus, option C is correct.
Quo warranto means “by what authority.” This writ allows anyone, not just the aggrieved party, to challenge a person’s legal right to hold a public office. It cannot be issued against ministerial offices.
Certiorari, meaning “certified,” is a writ issued by the High Court or Supreme Court to a lower court or tribunal to transfer a case for review or appeal.**

The position with respect to the lapsing of bills is as follows:



A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses (whether it originated in the Lok Sabha or was transmitted to it by the Rajya Sabha). Thus, statement 1 is correct.




A bill passed by the Lok Sabha but pending in the Rajya Sabha lapses. Thus, statement 2 is correct


A bill not passed by the two Houses due to disagreement and if the president has notified the holding of a joint sitting before the dissolution of Lok Sabha, does not lapse. Thus, statement 3 is incorrect.


A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha but not passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse.

Statement 3 is correct: Rajya Sabha, being a permanent House, is not subject to dissolution. Only the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution. Unlike a prorogation, a dissolution ends the very life of the existing House, and a new House is constituted after general elections are held.  Dissolution of the Lok Sabha is done by the President of India, who, save in exceptional circumstances, does so on the advice of the Council of Ministers.**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a)   1 only
- (b)   2 only

- (d)   Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation

Exp:
Statement 1 is incorrect: In Ryotwari system the government revenue was a fixed amount, irrespective of crop output, and was to be paid in cash. Thus during periods of bad crops or low prices the peasants were forced to borrow from moneylenders to pay the land revenue. Once in the clutches of moneylenders they were rarely able to free themselves from debt and the end result invariably was mortgage or sale of land.
Statement 2 is correct: In Zamindari system the revenue was invariable, regardless of the harvest, and had to be paid punctually. According to the Sunset Law, if payment did not come in by sunset of the specified date, the zamindari was liable to be auctioned.

## Science Technology

### Question 1

Which one of the following words/phrases is most appropriately used to denote “an interoperable network of 3D virtual worlds that can be accessed simultaneously by millions of users, who can exert property rights over virtual items”?

- (a) Big data analytics
- (b) Cryptography
- (c) Metaverse
- (d) Virtual matrix
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Metaverse is a network of immersive online worlds experienced typically through virtual reality or augmented reality. In this world, users would interact with each other and purchase goods and services, some of which would exist only online. Builders of metaverse technology consider it the next step in the evolution of the Internet after early 21st-century developments such as smartphone applications and social media.
The social network company Facebook is particularly active in building metaverse technology. The company acquired the virtual reality company Oculus in 2014, and in 2021, the company changed its name to Meta Platforms-

That same year, it released its metaverse application Meta Horizon Worlds, in which users can use Oculus headsets to play games created by other users. 
The application included a business platform, Meta Horizon Workrooms, in which users who work at locations remote from each other can interact as in a real office.

Although applications such as Meta Horizon Worlds and Roblox provide metaverse experiences, several advances are required for the technology to achieve its full potential- 

Interoperability is one such advance: even though the metaverse is being built by different companies and organisations, the user’s experience should be seamless and not depend on the conditions of any one platform. 
A user should also have a consistent virtual identity across metaverse worlds. 
Finally, property rights within the metaverse should be ensured.**

### Question 2

With reference to radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), consider the following statements:

1. RTGs are miniature fission reactors.

2. RTGs are used for powering the onboard systems of spacecrafts.

3. RTGs can use Plutonium-238, which is a by-product of weapons developments.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp:
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) are lightweight, compact spacecraft power systems that are extraordinarily reliable. Hence, statement 2 is correct. 
RTGs provide electrical power using heat from the natural radioactive decay of plutonium-238 in the form of plutonium oxide. The large difference in temperature between this hot fuel and the cold environment of space is applied across special solid-state metallic junctions called thermocouples, which generate an electrical current using no moving parts.
RTGs are used on NASA missions where other options, such as solar power, are impractical or incapable of providing the power that a mission may need to accomplish its scientific or operational goals. 
Sometimes referred to as “nuclear batteries,” RTGs are not fission reactors, and plutonium is not the type used for nuclear weapons. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect. 
Plutonium-238 is not a naturally occurring isotope on the planet, it was produced in greater quantity during the Cold War period as a by-product of the production of Plutonium-239 used for nuclear bombs.  Hence, statement 3 is correct.**

### Question 3

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: Giant stars live much longer than dwarf stars.

Statement-II: Compared to dwarf stars, giant stars have a greater rate of nuclear reactions.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I
- (c) Statement-I is correct, but Statement II is incorrect
- (d) Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
There are two kinds of large stars- 

Giant stars have masses from eight times to as much as 100 times that of the mass of our sun. 
These massive stars have hotter and denser cores than dwarf stars (stars that are smaller than five times the mass of our sun). 
Therefore, giant stars have a greater rate of nuclear reactions that light up stars. Hence, statement-II correct.
Massive stars also use up the hydrogen fuel in their core faster despite starting out with much more of it, meaning they live much shorter lives than dwarf stars. Hence, statement-I incorrect.
A giant star will also end its life in a spectacular fashion via a supernova explosion, leaving behind a strange object such as a neutron star or an even more bizarre black hole.
Giant stars, with their increased nuclear reaction rates, are more luminous than our sun. The smallest of the giant stars, with eight solar masses (that is, having eight times the mass of our sun) have luminosities, or brightnesses, about 1000 times that of our sun. More massive stars use up their fuel even more quickly: a 40 solar mass star can be 50,000 times as bright as our sun. Hence, Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct.**

### Question 4

Which one of the following is synthesised in the human body that dilates blood vessels and increases blood flow?

- (a) Nitric oxide
- (b) Nitrous oxide
- (c) Nitrogen dioxide
- (d) Nitrogen pentoxide
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
Gasotransmitters are a family of gaseous signalling molecules produced endogenously (in human body) that act at specific receptors to play imperative roles in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. Along with hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide, nitric oxide (NO) is a well-known gasotransmitter. It has earned repute as a potent vasodilator (increasing blood flow), also known as an endothelium-derived vasorelaxant factor (EDRF).**

### Question 5

Consider the following activities:

1. Identification of narcotics on passengers at airports or in aircraft

2. Monitoring of precipitation

3. Tracking the migration of animals

In how many of the above activities can the radars be used?

- (a) Only one
- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp:
Radar (Radio Detection And Ranging) is an electromagnetic sensor used for detecting, locating, tracking, and recognising objects of various kinds at considerable distances. It operates by transmitting electromagnetic energy toward objects, commonly referred to as targets, and observing the echoes returned from them. The targets may be aircraft, ships, spacecraft, automotive vehicles, astronomical bodies, or even birds, insects, and rain. Besides determining the presence, location, and velocity of such objects, radar can sometimes obtain their size and shape as well.
Radar has found an increasing number of important civilian applications: 



Air traffic control



Weather observation- Radar-based rainfall information has been widely used in hydrological and meteorological applications, as it provides data with a high spatial and temporal resolution that improves rainfall representation. Hence, statement 2 is correct.



Remote sensing of the environment
Aircraft and ship navigation
Speed measurement for industrial applications and for law enforcement
Space surveillance and planetary observation. 



Scientists are using weather radars, originally developed to measure rainfall, to study the flight patterns of birds, bats and insects. Hence, statement 3 is correct.
Radar technology is being used in the fight against narcotics, but they are being used for interdiction of suspicious flights/aircraft in countries like Guatemala, Brazil and Bolivia and not directly in the identification of narcotics on passengers or in the aircraft. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect.**

### Question 6

Consider the following aircraft:

1. Rafael

2. MiG-29

3. Tejas MK-1

How many of the above are considered fifth-generation fighter aircraft?

- (a) Only one
- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Fifth-generation combat aircraft differ from fourth-generation aircraft primarily in their stealth features. Fifth-generation aircraft have a low electro-magnetic signature, which makes it difficult for enemy radar to detect them. At the same time, fifth-generation aircraft have powerful sensors and new weapons, so they are able to register the signature of enemy aircraft and take them out.

Stealth features such as an internal weapons bay, and a bigger internal fuel tank are part of fifth-generation aircraft. External fuel tanks and externally attached weapons leave a huge signature and are easy to detect for radar.
Dassault Rafale (Rafael) is an omnirole 4.5th generation combat aircraft (capable of adapting to diverse combat scenarios and threats). Hence, option 1 is incorrect.
Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas Mk1A is an indigenous 4.5-generation, all-weather, multi-role fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force. Hence, option 2 is incorrect.
The Mikoyan MiG-29 is a 4th-generation jet fighter aircraft designed in the Soviet Union for an air superiority role. Hence, option 3 is incorrect.**

### Question 7

In which of the following are hydrogels used?

1. Controlled drug delivery in patients

2. Mobile air-conditioning systems

3. Preparation of industrial lubricants

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:

Hydrophilic polymeric networks that are capable of imbibing huge volumes of water and undergoing swelling and shrinkage suitably to facilitate controlled drug-release are called hydrogels. Their porosity and compatibility with aqueous environments make them highly attractive bio-compatible drug delivery vehicles. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
The idea of cooling using hydrogels is simple: a heat sink is coated with 0.5-1-millimeter-thick hydrogel layer. Used commonly in laptops and CPUs, heat sinks are metallic structures with fins and ridges to increase their surface area for more efficient heat transfer. The hydrogel coating absorbs moisture from the air and swells up when a processor is not running full tilt. During peak hours, when the processor heats up, the water evaporates and cools the electronics.Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Hydrogels have received extensive attention as functional lubricants because of their excellent anti-friction and anti-wear properties, tunable tribological performances, and effectiveness in alleviating lubrication failures caused by the creeping or leakage of conventional liquid lubricants owing to their semi-solid nature.Hence, statement 3 is correct.**

### Question 8

Which one of the following is the exhaust pipe emission from Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles, powered by hydrogen?

- (a) Hydrogen peroxide
- (b) Hydronium
- (c) Oxygen
- (d) Water vapour
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
A fuel cell uses the chemical energy of hydrogen or other fuels to cleanly and efficiently produce electricity. If hydrogen is the fuel, the only products are electricity, water vapour, and heat. Hence, option D is correct. 
Fuel cells are unique in terms of the variety of their potential applications; they can use a wide range of fuels and feedstocks and can provide power for systems as large as a utility power station and as small as a laptop computer.
HOW DO HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS WORK?
Simply put, fuel cells work by combining hydrogen gas (H2) with oxygen from the air – and the resulting chemical reaction produces electricity.
Schematic representation of a hydrogen based fuel cell.

Hydrogen atoms enter the fuel cell at the anode, while oxygen is fed to the cathode.
The fuel cell consists of a membrane coated with a catalyst. When the hydrogen molecules hit the catalyst, they’re split into hydrogen ions and electrons.
The membrane lets positively charged hydrogen ions pass through, but not the negatively charged electrons, which instead flow through an electric circuit where the electric current is generated.
At the cathode side, the hydrogen ions, electrons and the oxygen in the air combine to produce heat.
In order to produce enough electricity to be able to propel a vehicle, a complete fuel cell system consists of several hundred membranes stacked together.
The fuel cell system is adequate for normal use, but whenever extra power is needed, it’s provided by a battery on the machine. 
When the fuel cells produce more power than the machine currently needs, the excess energy can be used to charge the battery. The battery is also charged by regenerative braking.**

### Question 9

Recently, the term “pumped-storage hydropower” is actually and appropriately discussed in the context of which one of the following?

- (a) Irrigation of terraced crop fields
- (b) Lift irrigation of cereal crops
- (c) Long duration energy storage
- (d) Rainwater harvesting system
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Pumped storage hydropower (PSH) is a type of hydroelectric energy storage. It is a configuration of two water reservoirs at different elevations that can generate power as water moves down from one to the other (discharge), passing through a turbine. The system also requires power as it pumps water back into the upper reservoir (recharge). PSH acts similarly to a giant battery, because it can store power and then release it when needed. Hence, option C is correct. 
PSH can be characterized as open-loop or closed-loop:
Open loop and Closed loop PSH.**

### Question 10

“Membrane Bioreactors” are often discussed in the context of:

- (a) Assisted reproductive technologies
- (b) Drug delivery nanotechnologies
- (c) Vaccine production technologies
- (d) Wastewater treatment technologies
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
The membrane bioreactor (MBR) has emerged as an efficient compact technology for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment:

These systems have the advantage of combining a suspended growth biological reactor with solids removal via filtration. 
The membranes can be designed for and operated in small spaces and with high removal efficiency of contaminants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria, biochemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids.
Membrane filtration allows a higher biomass concentration to be maintained, thereby allowing smaller bioreactors to be used. 
The effluent from MBRs contains low concentrations of bacteria, total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and phosphorus. 
This facilitates high-level disinfection. 
Effluents are readily discharged to surface streams or can be sold for reuse, such as irrigtion.**
