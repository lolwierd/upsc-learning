Jainism vis-a-vis Buddhism


 
 
 
Similarities

•   Both were influenced by the Upanishads’ ideology as well as that of other Hindu religious groups. For instance, salvation is the ultimate aim of life.
•   Both groups welcomed members from various social classes while also catering to the socially outcast.
•   Both believed that Nirvana, or salvation, frees one from the cycle of perpetual birth and death.
•   Both placed more emphasis on moral principles than on engaging in ritualistic behaviour or paying homage to and worshipping God.







 
 
 
 
 
Differences

•   Jainism has endured in India throughout history, unlike Buddhism because Jains strictly adhere to their religious rules. However, Buddhism was nonetheless interpreted liberally in other cultures.
•   Jainism upholds a more comprehensive understanding of life. Every element of nature, both living and non-living, is said to have its own soul. However, Buddhism does not believe so.
•   Jainism believes that men and women who are householders cannot find salvation, in contrast to Buddhism, which does not make any distinctions between genders.
•   Jain teachings include opposition to animal sacrifices, including those made for spiritual purposes. In Buddhism, the concept of Ahimsa (non-violence) is different than in other religions. Ahimsa permits the eating of animal flesh where it is a necessity or traditional diet of the people.**

### Question 2

What would happen if phytoplankton of an ocean is completely destroyed for some reason?

1. The ocean as a carbon sink would be adversely affected.

2. The food chains in the ocean would be adversely affected.

3. The density of ocean water would drastically decrease.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Food Chain
Statement 1 is correct: Phytoplankton prefer iron and iron pulls carbon out of the atmosphere during photosynthesis, thus the complete destruction of phytoplankton would certainly affect the carbon sinking mechanism of the ocean.
Statement 2 is correct: In a balanced ecosystem, phytoplankton provide food for a wide range of sea creatures, thus Phytoplankton are considered the primary producers in the marine food chain, they are called the ‘grass of the sea’. Thus, the destruction of phytoplankton will certainly have an adverse effect on the marine food chain.
Statement 3 is incorrect: First of all the use of extreme words like ‘drastically’ in the statement is itself a red flag. Now coming to the main part of the statement, if the phytoplankton of an ocean is completely destroyed for some reason, then it may affect the marine food chain because when the phytoplankton disappeared, that affects the zooplankton, which then affects the small fish that ate the zooplankton, and the large fish that ate the small fish. So it’s like dominoes falling. Phytoplankton and macroalgae → zooplankton → small fish → large fish. Therefore, it may hardly affect the density of water.**

### Question 4

Consider the following agricultural practices:

Contour bunding
Relay cropping
Zero tillage

In the context of global climate change, which of the above helps/help in carbon sequestration/storage in the soil?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 3 only
- (c) 1, 2 and 3
- (d) None of them
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Agriculture practices
Option (b) is the correct answer: Zero Tillage helps in carbon sequestration/storage in the soil. Zero Tillage:

It is the process where the crop seed will be sown through drillers without prior land preparation and distributed in the soil where previous crop stubbles are present.
Zero tillage not only reduces the cost of cultivation it also reduces the soil erosion, crop duration, irrigation requirement and weed effect which is better than tillage. It also helps in carbon sequestration in the soil.

Contour bundling:

Contour bundling involves the construction of banks along the contours.
Terracing and contour bunding divide the hill slope into numerous small slopes, check the flow of water, promote absorption of water by soil and save soil from erosion.
Retaining walls of terraces control the flow of water and help in reducing soil erosion.

Relay Cropping:

Relay Cropping is the process of growing one crop, then planting another crop (usually a cover crop) in the same field before harvesting the first.
This helps avoid competition between the main crop and the intercrop.
It also uses the field for a longer time since the cover crop usually continues to grow after the main crop is harvested.**

- (a) The Earth’s magnetic field diverts them towards its poles.
- (b) Ozone layer around the Earth reflects them back to outer space.
- (c) Moisture in the upper layers of the atmosphere prevents them from reaching the surface of the
- (d) None of the statements (a), (b), and (c) given above is correct.
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Basics of Solar System
Earth’s Magnetic Field Diverts Electrically Charged Particles:
Option (a) is correct: Earth’s field lines start near the South Pole of the Earth, curve around in space, and converge again near the North Pole, it forms the magnetosphere, which deflects the Sun’s ions and electrons before they reach us. Most of the solar wind is diverted to poles.
Option (b) is incorrect: The ozone layer absorbs a range of ultraviolet energy, it has nothing to do with Electrically charged particles.
Option (c) is incorrect: Moisture in the upper layers of the atmosphere i.e. The Stratosphere prevents Ultraviolet rays from reaching the surface of the earth.**

### Question 3

Normally, the temperature decreases with the increase in height from the Earth’s surface, because

1. The atmosphere can be heated upwards only from the Earth’s surface

2. There is more moisture in the upper atmosphere.

3. The air is less dense in the upper atmosphere.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Atmosphere
Statement 1 is correct: Normal lapse rate that is 1-degree Celcius temperature falls at a height of every 165 mt in the troposphere. As we increase elevation, the air pressure decreases as there is less air above us. As the pressure decreases, air molecules spread out further i.e. air expands, and the temperature decreases and the atmosphere can be heated upwards only from the Earth’s surface. Temperature falls off with height at a predictable rate because the air near the surface is heated and becomes light, and the air higher up cools to space and becomes heavy.
Statement 2 is not correct: The water vapour, which accounts for around 1% of air varies greatly in the troposphere and decreases rapidly with altitude.
Statement 3 is correct: The air density in the atmosphere decreases with height and it helps in decreasing temperature.**

### Question 4

Which one of the following is the characteristic climate of the Tropical Savannah Region?

- (a) Rainfall throughout the year
- (b) Rainfall in winter only
- (c) An extremely short dry season
- (d) A definite dry and wet season
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Biomes/World Climate
Option (d) is correct: The Tropical Savannah Region is characterized by a definite dry and wet season.
Tropical Savannah Region:

The savanna biome, which is a type of grassland biome, consists of areas of open grassland with very few trees.
In the Wet Season, the weather is warm and a savanna receives as much as 50 inches of rain.
During the Dry Season, weather can be extremely hot, and rainfall will amount to only four inches each month.
This combination of high temperatures and little precipitation makes savannas perfect areas for grass and brush fires during their dry seasons.**

### Question 5

The acidification of oceans is increasing. Why is this phenomenon a cause of concern

1. The growth and survival of calcareous phytoplankton will be adversely affected.

2. The growth and survival of coral reefs will be adversely affected.

3. The survival of some animals that have phytoplanktonic larvae will be adversely

4. The cloud seeding and formation of clouds will be adversely affected.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1, 2 and 3 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Ocean Acidification
Statement 1 is correct: Ocean acidification ecreases the calcifying ability of corals, calcareous plankton, crustaceans etc.
Statement 2 is correct: Ocean acidification will affect corals and this will, in turn, affect one million species that have made corals their homes.
Statement 3 is correct: Coral reefs will erode faster than they can rebuild. When shelled organisms are at risk, the entire food web may also be at risk.
Statement 4 is incorrect: Atmospheric sulfur is produced and emitted by phytoplankton from the ocean in the form of dimethyl sulfide, the increase in ocean acidification led to an adverse impact on phytoplankton development and which led to a low amount of sulfur emission. This will decrease cloud formation in small amounts and not adversely affect indirectly on cloud formation.**

- (c) 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Option (d) is correct: The crops which are predominantly rainfed in India are Groundnut, Sesamum and Pearl millets.

Groundnut is a drought-tolerant crop that requires moderate rainfall for its growth and development. Rainfall for cultivation – 500 to 600 mm per annum, distributed rainfall pattern throughout the growing season. Groundnut can withstand a dry spell of 15-20 days during its vegetative stage, but it requires adequate moisture during the flowering and pod formation stages.
Sesamum requires temperature is 25°C to 30°C, can tolerate up to 40°C, sensitive to frost required rainfall is 500-600 mm, its drought-tolerant, excessive rainfall during flowering can cause lower yields . It requires well-drained Soil type, rich in organic matter, pH range of 5 to 8.0.
Pearl millet is a hardy crop that can grow in semi-arid regions. The ideal rainfall for pearl millet cultivation is between 400 to 600 mm per annum, with a well- distributed rainfall pattern throughout the growing season. Pearl millet can tolerate drought conditions and requires moisture during the early growth stages, especially during germination and tillering.
Rainfed areas receive more than 750 mm. Rainfed agriculture is carried out in a wide range of soil types, agro-climatic conditions, and annual rainfall ranges from 400 mm to 1600 mm. Rain-fed areas account for percent of millet production, 88 percent of pulses, 73 percent of cotton, 69 percent of oilseeds including groundnut and Sesame.

Deep Gorges, U-turn river courses, Parallel mountain ranges and steep gradients causing landslides – all these are representations or characterics of Himalayan youthful topography.
About Himalayan Physiography:

The Himalayas along with other Peninsular mountains are young, weak and flexible in their geological structure unlike the rigid and stable Peninsular Block.
Consequently, they are still subjected to the interplay of exogenic and endogenic forces, resulting in the development of faults, folds and thrust plains.
These mountains are tectonic in origin, dissected by fast-flowing rivers which are in their youthful stage.
In fact the whole mountain system of Himalaya represents a very youthful topography with high peaks, deep V-shaped valleys, gorges, rapids, waterfalls, steep slopes, etc.**

The amount of annual rainfall in the northern plains of India decreases from east to west.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Indian Monsoon

Monsoon refers to a seasonal change in wind patterns that results in a shift in precipitation patterns over a region. Monsoons occur primarily in tropical and subtropical regions and are characterized by a wet season and a dry season.
During the wet season, the winds bring in warm, moist air from over the oceans, which leads to increased rainfall over the land.
The dry season, on the other hand, is characterized by a shift in wind patterns, which brings in cooler, drier air from over the land, leading to a decrease in rainfall.

Statement 1 is correct: Due to its proximity to the sea, India’s southern region has earlier and longer rainy seasons than its northern region. Rainfall in the northern section of India diminishes as rain-bearing winds cross the western ghats and humidity decreases. The southwest monsoon and the retreating monsoon (northeast monsoon) bring rain to India’s southern region.
Statement 2 is correct: With growing distance from the sea, monsoon rainfall tends to decrease. During the southwest monsoon, Kolkata receives 119 cm, Patna 105 cm, Allahabad 76 cm, and Delhi 56 cm.**

## Modern History

### Question 1

With reference to Ryotwari Settlement, consider the following statements:

The rent was paid directly by the peasants to the government.
The government gave Pattas to the Rytos.

3. The lands were surveyed and assessed before being taxed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 1, 2 and 3
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Land Revenue Settlement

Statements 1 and 2 are correct: The Ryotwari System was started by Thomas Munro and Alexander Reed. It was started in the Baramahal district of Tamil Nadu and later spread to Madras, parts of Bombay, East Bengal, Assam and Kurg (Karnataka). It covered 51% of British India. Ryots (farmers) were given the ownership and other rights (Pattas) over the land and were required to pay the revenue directly to the government.
Statement 3 is correct: The Ryotwari System involved high taxes (50% in dryland and 60% in wetland) and strict collection.
Mahalwari System.




NOTE: Question on land settlement system came in 2011 – on land settlement system of Lord Cornwallis.**

### Question 2

Consider the following statements:

The most effective contribution made by Dadabhai Naoroji to the cause of Indian National Movement was that he-

1. Exposed the economic exploitation of India by the British.

2. Interpreted the ancient Indian texts and restored the self-confidence of Indians.

3. Stressed the need for eradication of all the social evils before anything else.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Economic Exploitation of the British/Economic critics of colonialism
Statement 1 is correct: Dadabhai Naoroji (Grand Old man of India) wrote the “Poverty and UnBritish Rule in India” a Propounded Drain of Wealth Theory and exposed the economic exploitation of India by the British.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Vivekananda, etc. interpreted the ancient texts and restored the self confidence of Indians, not Dadabhai Naoroji. Swami Dayananda Saraswati even gave the call to “go back to vedas”.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Raja Rammohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Keshav Chandra Sen, Atmaram Pandurang, etc. emphasised the need for eradication of all social evils before anything else. Dadabhai Naoroji wasn’t a social reformer.
NOTE: If we carefully look at statement 3, it talks about the “eradication of all the social evils”. This sounds absolute and exclusive because of the extreme word “all”. Eliminating all social evils was a mammoth and uphill task. So there is less possibility of correctness of this statement. If we take calculable risk of eliminating statement 3, we can get an answer. Moreover, Dadabhai Naoroji propounded “Drain of wealth theory”. It was about exposing the economic exploitation of India by the British. This makes statement 1 correct. Economic Exploitation of the British/ Economic critics of colonialism theme is significant with respect to Colonial history in India. In the past, many questions came from this particular topic to check the analytical ability of aspirants.**

### Question 3

Consider the following:

Assessment of land revenue on the basis of nature of the soil and the quality of crops.
Use of mobile cannons in warfare.
Cultivation of tobacco and red chillies.

Which of the above was/were introduced into India by the English?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2
- (c) 2 and 3
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Colonial Trade + Land Revenue Settlement
Statement 1 is incorrect: After getting the Diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1765 the major aim of the British East India Company was to increase their land revenue collection. So its policies were aimed at getting maximum income from land without caring of its consequences on cultivators and peasants. Three major systems of land revenue collection existed in India – Zamindari, Ryotwari and Mahalwari.
Statement 2 is incorrect: The first recorded use of Artillery in India is at the Battle of Adoni in 1368. In the Deccans the Bahamani kings led by Mohammand Shah Bahamani used a train of Artillery against the Raja of Vijaya-nagar.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Tobacco and Red Chillies were introduced by Portuguese not British.




NOTE: In general, assessment of land revenue on the basis of nature of the soil and the quality of crops itself cumbersome and administratively mammoth task. It also needs a high level of record-keeping practice on part of administration. So this statement sounds. Now, if we carefully go through Spectrum or Modern NCERT it is clear that Portuguese had introduced Tobacco in India.**

## Science Technology

### Question 1

What are the reasons for the people’s resistance to the introduction of Bt brinjal in India?

Bt brinjal has been created by inserting a gene from a soil fungus into its genome.
The seeds of Bt brinjal are terminator seeds and therefore, the farmers have to buy the seeds before every season from the seed companies.
There is an apprehension that the consumption of Bt brinjal may have adverse impact on health.
There is some concern that the introduction of Bt brinjal may have adverse effects on biodiversity.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1, 2 and 3 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 3 and 4 only
- (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: GM Crops

Statement 1 is incorrect: A gene called cry1Ac from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis was inserted into the brinjal to develop Bt Brinjal, a transgenic brinjal.
This brinjal has been genetically modified to withstand insects like the Brinjal Fruit and Shoot Borer (Leucinodes orbonalis).
Statement 2 is incorrect: Farmers will be free to save and sow as many seeds from Bt Brinjal open-pollinated cultivars as they like. They are not terminator seeds.
Statement 3 is correct: A Supreme Court- appointed expert group advised a 10-year moratorium on field trials of all genetically modified (GM) food crops and a complete ban on field trials of transgenics in crops of Indian origins when the case reached that court because consumption of Bt brinjal may have adverse impact on the health of people. Consequently, the government put a freeze on field trial of Bt Brinjal in 2010.
Statement 4 is correct: The government’s own task committee on biotechnology had recommended in 2004 that no GM crops be allowed in biodiversity-rich areas since biodiversity is essential for nutrition and sustainability.**

- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Biopesticides
Option (d) is correct: All of the above mentioned can be employed as Biopesticides, depending on the properties of specific species. Biopesticides are various biologically active natural substances that exist in nature and have inhibitory effects on crop diseases and insect pests. In general, the creation of biopesticide depends to a large extent on biological resources.

Three major classes of biopesticides are:

Microbial pesticides consist of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium, fungus, virus or protozoan) as the active ingredient used to control pests. The microorganism may occur naturally, be dead or alive, or be genetically engineered.
Biochemical pesticides are naturally occurring substances, such as plant extracts, fatty acids or pheromones, that control pests using a nontoxic mode of action to the pest.
Plant-Incorporated-Protectants (PIPs) are pesticidal substances that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant, such as corn and cotton.


All of the above mentioned can be employed as Biopesticides, depending on the properties of specific species.**

- (b) 2 only
- (c) 1, 3 and 4
- (d) None of the above can be cited as evidence
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Theories related to space and universe
Expansion of Universe

The Big Bang theory states that at some point of time the entire space was contained in a single point of very high density and temperature, from where the Universe has been witnessing expansion in all directions ever since.
Redshift and Blueshift describe how light changes with movement of objects in space closer or farther from us. While moving away, the light is shifted to the red end of the spectrum, as its wavelength gets longer. While moving closer, the light moves to the blue end of the spectrum, as its wavelength gets shorter. Galactic Redshift is related to the expanding Universe 
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is thought to be leftover radiation from the Big Bang, e, the time when the universe began. According to the theory, when the universe was born it underwent rapid inflation and expansion. (The universe is still expanding today, and the expansion rate appears different depending on observation). The CMB represents the heat left over from the Big Bang.
According to Hubble’s law, the expansion of the universe is such that the velocity at which the galaxy is moving away from the observer is increasing with time. It means that the universe will become colder increasingly as matter spreads across Space.
Statement 1 is correct: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is thought to be leftover radiation from the Big Bang, or the time when the universe began. As the theory goes, when the universe was born it underwent rapid inflation and expansion.
Statement 2 is correct: American astronomer Edwin Hubble was the first to describe the redshift phenomenon (galactic redshift) and tie it to an expanding universe (galaxies are drifting apart).
Statement 3 is incorrect: Movement of asteroids in space has nothing to do with the concept of expansion of the universe.
Statement 4 is incorrect: Occurrence of supernova explosion in space is not related to continued expansion of the Universe.**

The combustible gases generated from biomass gasification can be used for direct heat generation but not in internal combustion engines.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Non-Conventional Energy/ Renewable Energy

Statement 1 is correct: Rice husk, groundnut shells, and coconut shells can all be utilised in the biomass gasification process.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Biomass gasification involves burning of biomass in a limited supply of air to provide a combustible gas consisting of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane, water, nitrogen, along with contaminants like small char particles, ash and tars.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Combustible syngas is frequently used as a fuel for internal combustion engines or as a step in the synthesis of other compounds. The only combustible gases produced by biomass gasification are carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Consequently, the flammable gases produced by biomass gasification can be used for direct heat generation as well as in internal combustion engines.**

- (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Basic and Everyday Science

Statement 1 is correct: Graphene, a two- dimensional, atomic-scale, honey-comb lattice is an allotrope of carbon in which one atom forms each vertex. It is the basic structural unit of other allotropes, including graphite, charcoal, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. 
Statement 2 is correct: It is about 100 times stronger than the strongest steel with a hypothetical thickness of 3.35. A which is equal to the thickness of a graphene sheet. Carbon atoms are linked together in a single layer to form the hexagonal structure that makes up graphene. Graphene is so much thinner than paper (a million times thinner), that it is actually regarded as two dimensional.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Graphene is a single layer (monolayer) of carbon atoms, tightly bound in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. It is an allotrope of carbon in the form of a plane of sp2-bonded atoms with a molecular bond length of 0.142 nanometres.
Statement 4 is correct: Graphene is often produced as a powder and as a dispersion in a polymer matrix. This dispersion is supposedly suitable for advanced composites, paints and coatings, lubricants, oils and functional fluids, capacitors and batteries, thermal management applications, display materials, etc.**

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Basic and Everyday Science
The Correct answer is Option (a):

Cowpea and Green gram are known as pulses because they are a good source of protein and are widely used as a staple food in many parts of the world. However, they also have other uses, such as being used as fodder and green manure.
As fodder, Cowpea and Green gram are highly nutritious and can provide a good source of protein for They are also easy to grow and can be grown in a variety of conditions, making them an ideal choice for farmers looking to provide their animals with a healthy and sustainable food source.
As green manure, Cowpea and Green gram are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which can help to improve soil fertility and increase crop yields. They are often used in crop rotations, where they are grown for a season and then plowed back into the soil to improve its nutrient
Pigeon pea or Toor Dal is a traditionally Kharif crop sown in June-July with the onset of Monsoon in various agro-climatic zones of India.

Pigeon Pea belongs to the widespread family of pulses. In India Pigeon Pea is more popular as Arhar or red gram In India, split pigeon peas (toor dal) are one of the most popular pulses.
Being an important source of protein in a mostly vegetarian diet. In regions where it grows, fresh young pods are eaten as a vegetable.
The split dried seeds are used as a lentil, in dishes such as sambar (lentil soup).**
