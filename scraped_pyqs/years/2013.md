Sub-Theme: Aspect of Religious life of Harappan civilizations
Harappan civilization: The Harappan Civilization arose in the North -western part of the Indian subcontinent. It is called Harappan because this civilization was discovered first in 1921 at the modern site of Harappa situated in the province of West Punjab in Pakistan. The Harappan culture covered parts of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and the fringes of western Uttar Pradesh. It is older than the chalcolithic cultures which have been treated earlier, but it is far more developed than these cultures.
Statement 1 is incorrect: No building has been discovered in the Indus valley which can resemble a temple. Although “Great Bath” may have been used for ritual purposes by the Indus valley people.
Statement 2 is correct: Figurines resembling female deities and male gods have been found in the Indus Valley.

**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Foreign Travellers Account
Statement 1 is Roads and River- routes were not completely robbery-free. Hiuen-Tsang himself was looted a couple of times.
Statement 2 is correct. Criminal law was very severe. Mutilation was commonly practised. Ordeals by fire, water and poison were used to determine the innocence or guilt of a person. Statement 3 is correct. Duties were to be paid at trade barriers without fail. It was a source of income for the kingdom.




NOTE: If you observe statement 1 carefully, it states “roads and river routes were completely immune from robbery” which logically sounds an absolute and extreme statement. Another way to solve this question is to ask yourself, at that time was it possible to maintain roads and river routes completely immune from robbery? If we eliminate statement 1, we will get the correct answer !! Reading questions between the lines and with utmost attention is the key to solve otherwise seemingly difficult questions.**

- (b) Limited sunlight and paucity of nutrients
- (c) Water limits and fire
- (d) None of the above
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Ecological Succession
Option (c) is the correct answer: Water limits and Fire restrict trees to replace the grasses as a part of an ecological succession.
Grassland Ecosystem:

Grassland ecosystems are an early stage of succession in regions where the mature ecosystems are forests.
Grass ecosystems, on the other hand, are climax ecosystems in grassland regions when there is insufficient precipitation to support a forest.
Grass that dries out during the dry season ignites fires that decimate other plant species and their seeds.
In areas with little rainfall, where plants cannot thrive, grasslands develop.
A grassland environment transforms into a desert ecosystem as a result of constraining forces including water scarcity and forest
Therefore, the ecological succession of grassland is desert. It is, however, notable that the soil of the grassland ecosystem is rich in nutrients and organic matter and provides the largest biomass.**

The average ocean productivity is about 50 grams carbon per square metre per year;
The average land productivity is 160 grams carbon per square metre per year;
Salt marshes and mangroves have one of the highest productivity of 3300-6000 grams of carbon per square metre per

Productivity:

Productivity is the rate of biomass
Productivity is measured in mass per unit volume per unit time.
The quantity of biomass or organic matter created by plants during photosynthesis per unit area during a certain time is referred to as primary production.
Gross primary productivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter during photosynthesis.

A considerable amount of GPP is utilized by plants in respiration.
Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R), is the net primary productivity (NPP). GPP – R = NPP.


Secondary productivity is the rate at which consumers create new organic matter.**

A food chain is the successive transfer of nutrients and energy from one creature to
A food chain shows a straightforward and isolated relationship and only one component of the food or energy flow.
g. Grasses → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake→ Hawk/Eagle.
A trophic level is the name given to each step in the food chain.
The place an organism holds in a food chain determines its trophic level.
Top carnivores are at the end of a food chain, which begins with producers.
Types of Food Chains: 1) Grazing food chain and 2) Detritus food chain
Grazing food chain: The consumers which start the food chain, utilising the plant or plant part as their food, constitute the grazing food chain.
Detritus food chain: This type of food chain starts from organic matter of dead and decaying animals and plant bodies from the grazing food Dead organic matter or detritus feeding organisms are called detritivores or decomposers.
Statement 1 is correct: A food chain is a linear flow of energy and nutrients from one organism to another.

Statement 2 is incorrect: Food chains are found within the populations of a species but not among all species (Man won’t eat man).
Statement 3 is incorrect: A food web illustrates the numbers of each organism which are eaten by others, not the food chain.**

Electromagnetic Radiation: The radiation travels in waves and has electric and magnetic It consists of X-rays, gamma rays, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, radio waves, and microwaves.
Geothermal Energy: The primary driving force behind endogenic geomorphic processes is energy coming from within the ground. The primary sources of this energy are radioactivity, friction caused by tidal and rotational motion, and primordial heat from the earth’s formation.
Gravitational Force: In addition to being a directional force that activates all downward motions of matter, gravity stresses the constituent parts of the earth. Eg: Mass movement, Avalanche.
Plate Movements: Earthquakes and continent building are the results of plate
Rotation of the Earth: The unequal heating of the earth’s surface, which arises from rotation about its axis, creates pressure differences and generates winds.
Revolution of the Earth: Earth rotates in an elliptical orbit around the sun. The term “Aphelion” refers to the period when the distance between the sun and Earth is at its greatest and “Perihelion” to the period when it is at its shortest.
Thus, all of the above are responsible for bringing dynamic changes on the surface of the earth.**

Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Inflation
Statement 1 is correct: Inflation is the rise in prices of goods and services within a particular economy wherein, the purchasing power of consumers decreases, and the value of the cash holdings erode. Inflation redistributes wealth from creditors to debtors i.e. lenders suffer and borrowers benefit out of inflation. Bondholders have lent money (to debtors) and received a bond in return. So he is a lender, he suffers (Debtor benefits from inflation).
Statement 2 is incorrect: The statement has not used specifically the word “inflation- indexed bonds”, hence we cannot say Inflation benefits the bond-holders.**

### Question 2

Which one of the following is likely to be the most inflationary in its effect?

- (a) Repayment of public debt
- (b) Borrowing from the public to finance a budget deficit
- (c) Borrowings from banks to finance a budget deficit
- (d) Creating new money to finance a budget deficit
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Inflation
Option (d) is correct: Borrowing from banks to finance a budget deficit and Borrowing from the public to finance a budget deficit will lead to a decrease in the money supply in the market. Creating new money to finance a budget deficit will have more inflationary effect than Repayment of public debt, as it will lead to an increase in total money supply in the market.
Budget Deficit:

It refers to a situation where total expenditure exceeds the total revenue.
A tool for raising money to create a budget deficit is known as deficit financing.
There are three ways to finance a budget:

Creating new currency
Borrowing from internal sources like RBI, issuing bonds, etc.
Borrowing from External sources like WB, IMF, etc.


Inflation won’t occur if the government borrows money from the public by issuing bonds with lower interest In a similar manner, bank loans won’t cause inflation.**

There are several factors that can contribute to a rise in overall prices, including an influx of money into the economy, a decrease in the total amount of goods and services being produced, an uptick in demand for those goods and services, an increase in people’s earnings, and a rapid expansion of the population.
Statement 1 is correct: An increase in the money supply will cause Inflation.
Statement 2 is correct: A decrease in output will cause Inflation.
Statement 3 is correct: An increase in demand will cause Inflation.
Inflation:

It is the rise in prices of goods and services within a particular economy wherein, the purchasing power of consumers decreases, and the value of the cash holdings erode.
Inflation measures the average price change in a basket of commodities and services over time.
The opposite and rare fall in the price index of this basket of items is called ‘deflation’.
In India, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) measures inflation.
Some causes of inflation: Increase in demand, reduction in supply, demand-supply gap, excess circulation of money, increase in input costs, devaluation of currency, rise in wages, among others.
In India, inflation is primarily measured by two main indices: Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Refer PYQ for detailed and comparative explanation on WPI and CPI).

The disqualification was unfair, because it was intended to disgrace and discredit the judges who were of Indian descent.
A bill to end this prejudice in the judiciary was proposed in 1883 by lawmaker C.P. Ilbert. Europeans were vehemently against this Bill.
The Ilbert Bill controversy made educated Indians aware of the need of an all Indian organisation, resulting in the formation of Indian National Congress in 1885 in Bombay with early leadership of Dadabhai Naroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, WC Banerjee etc.
The Ilbert Bill Controversy is a high watermark in the history of the Indian National Movement. The immediate result of this awakening of India was the birth of the Indian National Congress in 1885, the very next year of Ripon’s departure.

Option (a) is incorrect: The Indian Arms Act (1878) imposed restrictions and it compelled the Indians to have license to keep, sell or purchase arms.
Option (b) is incorrect: The Vernacular Press Act (1878) posed restrictions on newspapers and magazines published in Indian languages.
Option (c) is  correct:  The  Ilbert  Bill Controversy 1883 was related to the removal of disqualifications imposed on the Indian magistrates with regard to the trial of the Europeans.
Option (d) is incorrect: On March 13th, 1879, Lord Lytton abolished the import duty on cotton goods except on the finest qualities and it has no relation with the Ilbert Bill controversy.**

### Question 2

The demand for the Tebhaga Peasant Movement in Bengal was for:

- (a) the reduction of the share of the landlords from one-half of the crop to one third.
- (b) the grant of ownership of land to peasants as they were the actual cultivators of the land.
- (c) the uprooting of Zamindari system and the end of serfdom.
- (d) writing off all peasant debts.
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Peasant Movement
Tebhaga Peasant Movement (1946) in Bengal demanded the share of the landlords to be reduced from one-half of the produce to one third of the produce.
Tebhaga Movement (1946):

In September 1946, the Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha gave a call to implement, through mass struggle, the Floud Commission recommendations of Tebhaga which means two-thirds’ share to the bargardars, the share-croppers also known as ‘bhagchasi’ or ‘adhyar’, instead of the one-half share.
The jotedars rented the land that the bargardars worked on.
The main slogan was “nij khamare dhan tolo,” which meant that sharecroppers should thresh their own paddy and not to the jotedar’s house, as before, so as to enforce tebhaga.
North Bengal was the epicentre of the movement, particularly among the Rajbanshis, a low caste with tribal origins. Muslims took part in great numbers as well.
The movement dissipated soon, as the League ministry’s sop of the Bargardari Bill, the popularisation of the Hindu Mahasabha’s campaign for a separate Bengal, and new riots in Calcutta, which eliminated the possibility of sympathetic support from the urban sections.




NOTE: If we read or Modern NCERT carefully, Tebhaga literally means ‘three shares’ of harvests. Option 1 talks about the “one-third” part. With just knowing the meaning of “Tebhaga’’, we can solve the given question.**

### Question 3

The people of India agitated against the arrival of the Simon Commission because:

- (a) Indians never wanted the review of the working of the Act of 1919
- (b) Simon Commission recommended the abolition of Dyarchy (Diarchy) in the Provinces
- (c) There was no Indian member in the Simon Commission
- (d) The Simon Commission suggested the partition of the country
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub -Theme: Administrative Refor m/ Constitutional Reforms
Simon Commission (1927):

The Indian Statutory Commission, commonly referred to as the Simon Commission, was a group of seven British Members of Parliament under the chairmanship of Sir John Simon who arrived in British India in
Objective: The Simon Commission was appointed by the British government to assess India’s constitutional development and recommend constitutional reforms.
Many Indians strongly opposed the Commission for a variety of reasons. The main reason behind the agitation against Simon Commission was that there were no Indian members of the panel and only seven British members of the British Parliament. This was viewed as racist and colonist.**

### Question 4

Quit India Movement was launched in response to:

- (a) Cabinet Mission Plan
- (b) Cripps Proposals
- (c) Simon Commission Report
- (d) Wavell Plan
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Quit India Movement
The failure of the Cripps Mission to resolve the constitutional deadlock made it clear to the nationalists that any silence would amount to accepting the right of the British to decide the fate of Indians without consulting them.

Quit India Movement was launched in response to Mahatma Gandhi’s national call for satyagraha. The All-India Congress Committee proclaimed a mass protest demanding what Gandhiji called “an orderly British withdrawal” from India.
The Quit India resolution was ratified at the Congress meeting at Gowalia Tank, Bombay on August 8, 1942.**

- (a) directly elected by the people of those Provinces
- (b) nominated by the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League
- (c) elected by the Provincial Legislative Assemblies
- (d) selected by the Government for their expertise in constitutional matters
Explanation


**Ans: c          
 Sub-Theme: Constitutional Development
The idea of a constituent assembly was put forward for the first time by MN Roy. The Indian National Congress (INC) first formally requested a constituent assembly to draft an Indian constitution in 1935. Representatives of each community were to be elected by members of that community in the provincial legislative assembly and voting was to be by the method of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote. Composition of the Constituent Assembly:

C.A. constituted in Nov 1946 under CMP (Cabinet Mission Plan).
Seats allotted as per population proportion.
Voting using a single transferable vote and the proportional representation system when a province is represented.
Mahatma Gandhi was not part of C.A.
Strength of the assembly:

Total strength of the assembly: 389
296 seats for British India and 93 seats to princely states
292 seats allocated for British India were to be from eleven governor’s provinces and four from Chief commissioner’s provinces.
Seats were allocated based on proportion to their respective population.
Muslims, Sikhs, and general voters were to determine which of the three major populations in each British province would hold the seats up for election in the provincial legislative assembly.
The heads of these princely states were supposed to nominate the representatives.**

Consider the following minerals:

Calcium
Iron
Sodium

Which of the minerals given above is/are required by the human body for the contraction of muscles?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Components of Food/Balanced Diet
Option (d) is correct: Specific minerals like calcium, Iron sand sodium play a part in muscle contraction.

Skeletal muscle attached to our skeleton, contracts to maintain our posture and support movement, whereas cardiac muscle makes up our heart and contracts with each heartbeat.
Our airways, digestive system, blood vessels, and other tissues are lined with smooth muscle, and the contraction of this muscle is important for digestion, circulation, and other physiological activities.
Specific minerals play a part in muscle contraction:

Calcium: Calcium is essential for activating enzymes that cause muscle contraction.
Iron: Iron helps to support continued functioning of the muscle by supporting energy production in your muscle cells, so that muscle fibres always have the energy they need to contract properly. Also supports healthy circulation so that muscles can receive additional oxygen from the bloodstream and helps muscles store oxygen to power muscle contractions.
Sodium: Sodium balances potassium to maintain membrane potential, it is necessary for muscular contraction.






NOTE: This is a simple, easy and direct question from NCERT. Therefore, it is very much important for the aspirants to read and understand each and every concept including the minor details from the NCERTs.**

### Question 4

Which of the following statements is/are correct?

Viruses lack enzymes necessary for the generation of energy
Viruses can be cultured in any synthetic medium.
Viruses are transmitted from one organism to another by biological vectors only

Select the correct answer using the codes given below.

- (a)  1 only
- (b)  2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d)  1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Virus

Statement 1 is correct: Viruses do not have the chemical machinery needed to survive on their own.
Statement 2 is incorrect: The virus can’t reproduce itself without another cell to “build” its copies. Therefore we can’t grow a virus on synthetic media.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Viruses enter the body from the environment or other individuals from soil to water to air via nose, mouth, or any breaks in the skin and seek a cell to infect.
Viruses lack the necessary chemical apparatus for independent survival.
Viruses look for host cells where they can reproduce. On artificial medium, such as agar, viruses cannot thrive, although they can on bacterial On the other hand, viruses resemble little aliens.
Since they don’t consume nutrients or excrete waste, they aren’t really considered to be “living.” Instead, they attach to another cell (such as a bacterium) and inject it with their own viral genetic material.
Without a second cell to “build” its copies in, the virus is unable to replicate. As a result, we are unable to grow viruses on artificial media.
Viral contamination from the environment or other people enters the body through the nose, mouth, or any openings in the air, water, or soil.**

### Question 5

Which of the following diseases can be transmitted from one person to another through tattooing?

Chikungunya
Hepatitis B
HIV-AIDS

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Disease transmission
Option (b) is correct:

Tattoos may cause diseases because tattoo instruments come in contact with blood and bodily fluids if the instruments are used on more than one person without being sterilised.
When tattoo instruments are used on multiple people without being sanitised, they come into contact with blood and body fluids and may spread illnesses.
However, tattoo-related infections are uncommon in sterile, contemporary tattoo parlours using single-use needles.
Surface diseases of the skin, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, TB, and HIV are among the pathogens that could theoretically be spread through the use of unsterilized tattoo equipment or contaminated ink. However, no one has been documented to have acquired HIV through a commercial tattooing procedure.
Through the bite of an infected mosquito, the chikungunya virus is transmitted to humans. There is no spread of the Chikungunya virus (it cannot be spread directly from person to person).**

### Question 6

Consider the following statements:

Size of the sun at dusk
Colour of the sun at dawn
Moon being visible at dawn
Twinkle of stars in the sky
Polestar being visible in the sky

Which of the above are optical illusions?

- (a) 1, 2 and 3
- (b) 3, 4 and 5
- (c) 1, 2 and 4
- (d) 2, 3 and 5
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Light
Optical Illusion

An optical illusion also called a visual illusion that is characterized by visually perceived images that differ from object than reality. The information that is gathered by the eye is processed in the brain that gives a perception that does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source.
Statement 1 is correct: Size of the sun at dusk: There are no known objects of a similar size as the sun (or moon) when it is high in the sky. The sun, however, appears even larger when it is low in the sky because we can see distant objects near the horizon that we know to be large.
Statement 2 is correct: Colour of the sun at dawn: There are many different colours in light. Red is the colour that moves the farthest out of all of those others. As the sun sets, crimson is the final hue to be seen. Red is the last colour to appear when the other colours begin to fade (red is the fastest).
Statement 3 is incorrect: Moon being visible at dawn: The moon is visible somewhere in the sky at dawn during the entire half of the cycle of phases from Full Moon to just before New Moon.
Statement 4 is correct: Twinkle of stars in the sky: Light is constantly emitted by stars. Before reaching our sight, this light passes through a number of layers of the earth’s atmosphere. Because different layers of atmosphere have different refractive indices, stars appear to be blinking.
Statement 5 is in correct: Polestar being visible in the sky: It is not an optical illusion because Polestars appear in the North or South pole that completely depends on earth rotation.**

It will enable us to create better fuels for nuclear

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Scientific innovation and discoveries
Higgs Boson

It has long been believed that the Higgs boson holds the key to unlocking the origin of mass puzzle. A phenomenon known as the Higgs field, which is believed to permeate the whole cosmos, is connected to the Higgs boson. According to the theory, as other particles go through this field, they gain mass similarly to how swimmers moving through a pool gain wetness.
The Higgs Boson is not the key component that will enable teleportation, but it will aid in our understanding of mass, objects, and time and space travel.
The Higgs Boson may, in the near or distant future, assist us in developing an incredible energy source that could open the door to better fuels for our nuclear missions.
Statement 1 is correct: The Higgs boson has long been thought the key to resolving the mystery of the origin of mass.
Statement 2 is incorrect: The Higgs Boson is not a main item that will open the way for teleportation but it will help to understand about mass, item and travel in time and space.
Statement 3 is incorrect: In the near or far future, the Higgs Boson may help us to create an unbelievable energy source which can pave the way for better fuels for our Nuclear missions.**

### Question 8

Fruits stored in a cold chamber exhibit longer storage life because

- (a) Exposure to sunlight is prevented
- (b) Concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment in increased
- (c) Rate of respiration in decreased
- (d) There is an increase in humidity
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Basic and Everyday Science
The Correct answer is Option (c):

After being harvested, fruits and vegetables stay metabolically active. Respiration is a manifestation of metabolic The rate of respiration can be decreased effectively by lowering the temperature.
Fruits and vegetables can use the energy released during respiration for internal functions. To effectively store your fruit, controlling respiration is crucial.
The fruits and vegetables can be preserved in good condition as long as the respiration process can The product will have to survive off of the nutrients it already has because it is no longer connected to the plant’s roots or other sections, so it won’t receive any additional nutrients. The fruits and veggies will therefore start to degrade after everything is done.**

### Question 9

Ball bearings are used in bicycles, cars, , because–

- (a) The actual area of contact between the wheel and axle is increased
- (b) The effective area of contact between the wheel and axle is increased
- (c) The effective area of contact between the wheel and axle is reduced
- (d) None of the above statements is correct
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Basic and Everyday Science
The Correct answer is Option (c): About Ball bearings:

Ball bearings are used to reduce friction between the surfaces.
A ball bearing is a specific kind of rolling- element bearing that uses balls to keep the bearing races apart. A ball bearing’s main functions are to support radial and axial loads and lessen rotational friction.
In order to reduce friction between surfaces and also because the effective area of contact between the wheel and axle is reduced, ball bearings are used in bicycles, vehicle axles, etc.
The form of a ball bearing is spherical. These don’t drag each other when they move; instead, they roll. These can be moved with a little force and When compared to static friction and dynamic friction, rolling friction—which is what moves these—is the least forceful.**

### Question 11

Many transplanted seedlings do not grow because

- (a) The new soil does not contain favourable minerals
- (b) Most of the root hairs grip the new soil too hard
- (c) Most of the root hairs are lost during transplantation
- (d) Leaves get damaged during transplantation
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Transplantation
About Transplanted Seedlings:

It typically results from injury to the plant’s roots during transplantation. The majority of the water that is finally delivered to the plant’s top growth is absorbed by tiny roots that are farther from the plant and are covered by even smaller hairs.
These delicate roots are typically killed after a transplant either by being chopped to reduce the size of the root ball or by drying out (some accounts say it only takes 3-4 minutes of exposure to air for these to die). It’s referred to as transplant shock.
Transplant shock refers to a number of stresses that occur in recently transplanted trees and shrubs. It involves failure of the plant to root well, consequently the plant establishes poorly in the landscape.
New transplants frequently experience stress due to a shortage of water because their root systems are not yet well established. Water stressed plants may be more vulnerable to harm from other factors, such as the environment, insects, or**

### Question 12

The known forces of nature can be divided into four classes, viz., gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. With reference  to them, which one of the following statements is not correct?

- (a) Gravity is the strongest of the four
- (b) Electromagnetism acts only on particles with an electric charge
- (c) Weak nuclear force causes radioactivity
- (d) Strong nuclear force holds protons and neutrons inside the nucleus of an atom
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Basic and Everyday Science
The Correct answer is Option (a):

Fundamental Forces of Nature:

The Fundamental Forces of Nature can be categorised in four categories like
Gravitational force, Weak Nuclear force, Electromagnetic force and Strong Nuclear force.
The weak and strong forces are influential only over a very short range and dominate only at the level of subatomic particles.
Gravity and Electromagnetic force have unlimited range.


Gravitational Force – Weakest force; but has unlimited range. (Not part of the standard model). Gravitational Force is not the strongest force rather the weakest
The Remaining three forces belong to the standard model of physics.
Strong Nuclear Force – Strongest; but has short range.





Strong Nuclear Force > Electromagnetic Force > Weak Nuclear Force > Gravitational Force.





Between moving charged particles, the magnetic force operates. This means that regardless of movement, every charged particle emits an electric field. Hence Electromagnetism functions exclusively on particles with an electric charge.
The weak nuclear force can transform a neutron into a proton in a process called nuclear decay. Subatomic particles are released at speeds close to the speed of light as a neutrally charged neutron is changed into a positively charged proton by the weak nuclear force.
The nuclear fusion reaction that powers the Sun is started by this (weak nuclear) force, which also controls the decay of unstable subatomic particles like mesons.
The strong nuclear force that holds protons and neutrons together holds the atom’s nucleus together. Although the strong nuclear force is the strongest of the four fundamental forces, it acts only over very short – typically nuclear – distances. It binds together the protons and neutrons in the nucleus.**
