### Question 1

Regarding the Indus valley civilization, consider the following statements:

It was predominantly a secular civilization and the religious element, though present, did not dominate the scene.
During this period, cotton was used for manufacturing textiles in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 and 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Religious aspect of Harappan civilization and significant features
Statement 1 is correct: Indus Valley people used to worship trees and animals. No traces of the practice of religion have been found at any site. The understanding of the religious rituals and beliefs of the Harappans is entirely based on the terracotta figurines and seals that have survived. The Harappan religion is normally termed as “animism” i.e., worship of trees, stones etc. A large number of terracotta figurines discovered at the Harappan sites have been associated with the worship of the mother goddess. Evidence of fire worship has also been found at some sites such as Kalibangan and Lothal. The burial practices and rituals have been a very important aspect of religion in any culture. Kalibangan has yielded evidence of a symbolic burial. Despite having the engineering know-how, the Indus Valley civilization did not build any grand palaces. Religious rituals were mostly performed in private houses, little temples, or outside.
Statement 2 is correct: In 1929 cotton textile fragments were found from Mohenjo-Jo-Daro. Also, cotton seeds found nearby Mehrgarh dated to 5000 BCE.**

### Question 2

The Jain philosophy holds that the world is created and maintained by:

- (a) Universal law
- (b) Universal Truth
- (c) Universal Faith
- (d) Universal Soul
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Philosophical aspect of Jainism
The correct answer is Option (a): Jain philosophy holds that the world is created and maintained by Universal laws. Jainism does not support belief in the creator deity. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time and motion) have always existed. The first Jain Tirthankara was Rishabnatha. Mahavira was the twenty-fourth and last Tirthankara. Jainism did not condemn the concept of the varna system. Jainism believes in the theory of Karma. Both the idea of reincarnation and the universal soul are accepted in Jainism. Jainism rejects the idea of a creator god. The universe and all of its elements, including soul, matter, space, time, and motion, have existed forever, in accordance with Jain theology. To break free from the circle of karma and reach salvation, Jainism teaches that one must lead a life of extreme austerity and penance. Jainism holds to the “theory of Karma” and the “transmigration of the soul.” Anekantavada: Stresses that there are many different facets to the ultimate truth and reality, or the “theory of plurality.” Syadavada: Literally, means the procedure of analysing various probability. Five Doctrines Of Jainism: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Aparigraha, Brahmacharya.**

### Question 3

India maintained its early cultural contacts and trade links with Southeast Asia across the Bay of Bengal. For this pre-eminence of the early maritime history of the Bay of Bengal, which of the following could be the most convincing Solution/Solutions?

- (a) As compared to other countries, India had better ship-building technology in ancient and medieval times.
- (b) The rulers of southern India always patronised traders, Brahmin priests and Buddhist monks in this context.
- (c) Monsoon winds across the Bay of Bengal facilitated sea voyages.
- (d) Both (a) and (b) are convincing Solutions in this context.
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub Theme: Early Maritime History of India
Option (c) is correct: Indians have been familiar with the monsoon winds since the Gupta era. The Bay of Bengal’s monsoon winds made sea travel easier, this was the primary factor in India’s early commerce and cultural connections with Southeast Asia.



NOTE: In option (b), “southern India always patronised traders” seems extreme and an absolute statement. Option (a) also seems incorrect, however the question is talking about “most convincing Solution/ Solutions” so it will be option (c).**

## Environment Ecology

### Question 1

In the context of ecosystem productivity, marine upwelling zones are important as they increase marine productivity by bringing the:

Decomposer microorganisms to the surface.
Nutrients to the surface.
Bottom-dwelling organisms to the surface.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3
- (d) 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-theme: Ecosystem productivity/Energy Flow
Option (b) is the correct answer: Marine upwelling brings nutrients to the surface.
Upwelling:

It is a process in which deep, cold water of the ocean rises toward the surface.
Winds blowing across the ocean surface pushes the water away. Water then rises up from beneath the surface to replace the water that was pushed away. This process is known as “upwelling.”
Upwelling is usually observed at the equator where surface waters diverge, in the vicinity of Antarctica where the east and west winds drift, and along coastlines where the wind blows in a way that the Ekman Transport pushes water away from the coast.
The water that upwelling causes to rise to the surface is usually cooler and nutrient-
Surface waters are “fertilised” by these nutrients, which means that they frequently have high biological As a result, good fishing spots are usually found where upwelling is frequent
Statement 1 and 3 are incorrect: At the upwelling zone no such movement of organisms can be observed, they would remain at their position.
Statement 2 is correct: Deep ocean water during upwelling is usually extremely cold and nutrient- rich. We frequently find very productive waters in upwelling locations as a result.**

### Question 2

If a tropical rainforest is removed, it does not regenerate quickly as compared to a tropical deciduous forest. This is because

- (a) The soil of rainforest is deficient in nutrients
- (b) Propagules of the trees in a rainforest have poor viability
- (c) The rain forest species are slow-growing
- (d) Exotic species invade the fertile soil of rainforest
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Types of ecosystem/Forest/ Biomes
Option (a) is correct: The high volume of rainfall in tropical rainforests leaches out most of the nutrients from the soil and makes these soils virtually useless and nutrient deficient for agricultural purposes.
Option (b) is incorrect: Propagule is a vegetative structure that can become detached from a plant and give rise to a new plant, e.g. a bud, sucker, or spore. Seed bearing plants are more significant than Propagules in rainforests.
Option (c) is incorrect: In the rainforest, the plant species generally compete with each other for sunlight and while doing so they grow so fast that they rapidly consume the nutrients from the decomposed leaf litter. As a result, most of the nutrients are contained in the trees and other plants rather than in the soil.
Option (d) is incorrect: Though the exotic invasive species are a threat to rainforests (E.g. Most plantation crops like rubber, palm etc.) but it is also true that the rainforest soil is heavily leached, nutrient deficient, and thus less fertile.**

In situ Conservation


•   Ex situ conservation is the preservation of biodiversity away from their natural habitats. Here, zoological or botanical parks are places where animals and plants are raised or grown.
•   In situ conservation refers  to the
preservation of plants and animals in their natural environments.






•   Another method of ex situ conservation is the reintroduction of an animal or plant into its former environment. For instance, the extinct Gangetic gharial has been brought back into the rivers of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan.
•   Important locations for ex situ conservation include seed banks, botanical, horticultural, and recreational gardens.
•   This includes the establishment of:
1.  National      parks and sanctuaries
2.  Biosphere reserves
3.  Nature reserves
4.  Reserved        and protected forests
5.  Preservation plots
6.  Reserved forests**

- (b) 2, 4 and 6
- (c) 1, 3 and 5
- (d) 3, 4 and 6
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Biodiversity Hotspot
Biodiversity Hotspot:

Biodiversity hotspots are regions with high species richness and a high degree of
In 1988, the British biologist Norman Myers coined the term “biodiversity hotspot” as a biogeographic region characterized both by exceptional levels of plant endemism and by serious levels of habitat loss.
In 1989, Conservation International (CI) adopted Myers’ hotspots as its institutional model and provided the following qualifications for a hotspot:

Species endemism: It includes at least 1,500 vascular plant species that are unique to the planet (endemic species).
Degree of Threat: Primary native vegetation has lost at least 70% of its original coverage.



Statement 1 and 3 are correct: Species richness and endemism is one of the major criteria which must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (> 0.5% of the world’s total) as endemics.
Statement 5 is correct: ‘Degree of Threat’ is also a major criteria for the recognition of biological hotspots. It has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat. (It must have 30% or less of its original natural vegetation). In other words, it must be threatened.
Statement 2, 4 and 6 are incorrect: Are not the criteria for the recognition of Biodiversity Hotspots.**

### Question 6

Consider the following statements:

1. Biodiversity is normally greater in the lower latitudes as compared to the higher latitudes.

2. Along the mountain gradients, biodiversity is normally greater in the lower altitudes as compared to the higher altitudes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Biomes
Patterns of Biodiversity:

Latitudinal gradients: The diversity of plants and animals varies widely over the world.
The diversity of species declines as we move from the equator to the pole.
Than temperate or polar regions, the tropics are home to more species.

Statement 1 is correct: Diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world. Species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the pole.
Statement 2 is correct: Elevational diversity gradient (EDG) is an ecological pattern where biodiversity changes with elevation. The EDG states that species richness tends to increase as elevation increases, up to a certain point, creating a “diversity bulge” at middle elevations, after which it decreases with altitude. Therefore, it is true that along the mountain gradients, biodiversity is normally greater in the lower altitudes as compared to the higher altitudes.**

### Question 10

There is a concern over the increase in harmful algal blooms in the seawaters of India. What could be the causative factors for this phenomenon?

Discharge of nutrients from the estuaries.
Run-off from the land during the monsoon.
Upwelling in the seas.

Select the correct answer from the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Water Pollution
Algal Bloom:

A rapid rise in the population of algae in an aquatic system is known as an algal bloom, marine bloom, or water bloom.
Algal blooms can appear in both marine and freshwater habitats.
“Harmful algal blooms (HAB)” are blooms that can affect wildlife or the environment.
Harmful Algal Bloom can lead to fish die- offs, cities cutting off water to residents, or states having to close fisheries.

Responsible Factors for ALGAL BLOOM



•   Nutrients


•   Temperature


•   Light






•   Stable (Calm Waters) Conditions


•   Turbidity


•   Aquaculture Operations



Statement 1 is correct: Nutrients promote and support the growth of algae and Cyanobacteria. The Eutrophication (nutrient enrichment) of waterways is considered as a major factor behind the increase in harmful algal blooms.
Statement 2 is correct: External sources include runoff and soil erosion from fertilized agricultural areas, erosion from river banks, river beds, land clearing (deforestation), and sewage effluent.
Statement 3 is correct: Water that rises to the surface as a result of upwelling is typically colder and is rich in nutrients, which again leads to algal blooms.**

### Question 11

Human activities in the recent past have caused the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but a lot of it does not remain in the lower atmosphere because of

Its escape into the outer stratosphere.
The photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the oceans.
The trapping of air in the polar ice caps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3
- (d) 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Carbon Mitigation Strategies
Carbon Sequestration:

To slow down global warming, carbon sequestration involves the capture and storage of CO2. It is captured from the air, industries or power stations and stored permanently underground.
This promotes Long-term reserve of CO2 or forms of carbon to control temperatures.
Lowering of the amount of GHGs present in the air due to combustion of fossil fuels.

3 main steps to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS):

Trapping & separating CO2 from other gases
Transporting captured CO2 to storage location
Storing CO2 far from the atmosphere, either in the deep ocean or underground.

Statement 1 is incorrect: Some amount of CO2 does escape but not much CO2 is denser than Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon (the main components of the atmosphere) and thus this tend to stay more in the lower atmosphere, however, this does not stop some of it moving to the upper atmosphere by the process of diffusion.
Statement 2 is correct: The photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the oceans is natural carbon sequestration.
Statement 3 is incorrect: The trapping of CO2 by polar ice is not known.**

### Question 13

The formation of ozone hole in the Antarctic region has been a cause of concern. What could be the reason for the formation of this hole?

- (a) Presence of prominent tropospheric turbulence; and inflow of chlorofluorocarbons
- (b) Presence of prominent polar front and stratospheric clouds; and inflow of chlorofluorocarbons.
- (c) Absence of polar front and stratospheric clouds; and inflow of methane and chlorofluorocarbons.
- (d) Increased temperature at polar region due to global warming
Explanation


**Ans: b
 Sub-Theme: Ozone Depletion
Option (b) is the correct answer: Formation of Polar front, Polar Stratospheric Clouds lead to formation of ozone hole in the Antarctic region.

The formation of the ozone hole in the Antarctic has been an annual occurrence (in the months of September, October and November, due to a set of special meteorological and chemical conditions that arise at the South Pole, such as the presence of strong polar front, polar stratospheric clouds and increasing inflow of human- made chemicals like CFCs, etc.

Antarctic Ozone Hole:

The Antarctic “ozone hole” was discovered by British Antarctic Survey scientists Farman, Gardiner and Shanklin in 1985.

Causes:

Due to an increase in halocarbons (a compound in which the hydrogen of a hydrocarbon is replaced by halogens like chlorine, bromine, iodine etc.) in the atmosphere.
Presence of Polar Front which is a large area of low pressure and cold air that surrounds both of Earth’s poles.
The Cl-catalysed ozone depletion is enhanced in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) convert “reservoir” compounds into reactive free radicals (Cl and ClO), which in turn deplete ozone. In this way, PSCs accelerate ozone depletion.**

### Question 14

Regarding “carbon credits”, which one of the following statements is not correct?

- (a) The carbon credit system was ratified in conjunction with the Kyoto Protocol
- (b) Carbon credits are awarded to countries or groups that have reduced greenhouse gases below their emission quota
- (c) The goal of the carbon credit system is to limit the increase of carbon dioxide emission
- (d) Carbon credits are traded at a price fixed from time to time of the United Nation Environment Programme
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Carbon Mitigation Strategies
Carbon Credit:

A carbon credit is a permit that allows the company the right to emit 1 ton of CO2 or its equivalent.
One credit permits the emission of a mass equal to one ton of carbon dioxide
Options (a), (b) and (c) are correct: The carbon credit system was ratified in conjunction with the Kyoto Protocol under UNFCCC to encourage groups or countries to reduce carbon emissions.
Option (d) is incorrect: Carbon credit prices are traded on an exchange and their prices are never fixed.**

- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Wind System
Option (a) is correct: The Southern hemisphere has less landmass as compared to the northern hemisphere. The Coriolis force is the same in both hemispheres.
Landmass in both the Hemispheres:

The Northern Hemisphere’s surface is about 40% landmass and is covered by about 60% water in the Northern
The Southern Hemisphere’s surface is about 20% landmass and is covered by 80% water.
Circulating air is deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere as a result of the Earth’s axis of This is known as the Coriolis effect.


The latitude and airspeed have a direct correlation with the amount of deflection the air makes. At the equator, the Coriolis force is zero, while maximum at the poles.**

### Question 3

The jet aircraft fly very easily and smoothly in the lower stratosphere. What could be the appropriate explanation?

1. There are no clouds or water vapour in the lower stratosphere.

2. There are no vertical winds in the lower Stratosphere.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct in this context?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Layers of Atmosphere
Option (c) is correct: The conditions are practically perfect for flying airplanes since this layer is almost completely devoid of clouds and related weather disturbances. So airplanes fly in the lower stratosphere, sometimes in the upper troposphere where weather is calm.

The increase in the temperature with height in the stratosphere makes this region a stable place where the air tends not to overturn vertically. Thus vertical winds are almost absent in Stratosphere


About Stratosphere:

It is located above the troposphere up to 50 km above the surface of the earth.
The thickness of the stratosphere is highest at the poles.**

### Question 4

The 2004 Tsunami made people realize that mangroves can serve as a reliable safety hedge against coastal calamities. How do mangroves function as a safety hedge?

- (a) The mangrove swamps separate the human settlements from the sea by a wide zone in which people neither live nor venture out
- (b) The mangroves provide both food and medicines which people are in need of after any natural disaster.
- (c) The mangrove trees are tall with dense canopies and serve as an excellent shelter during a cyclone or tsunami
- (d) The mangrove trees do not get uprooted by storms and tides because of their extensive roots.
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Mangroves
Option (d) is correct: because mangroves function as a safety hedge in preserving ecological stability. The dense tangle of roots allows the trees to withstand storms, cyclones or even the daily rise and fall of tides.
Mangroves:

A mangrove is a small tree or shrub that grows along coasts, setting roots in salty sediments, usually beneath water.
Mangrove trees can withstand the tides’ daily rise and fall due to their complex web of roots and extensive roots.**

Inflation:

It is the rise in prices of goods and services within a particular economy wherein, the purchasing power of consumers decreases, and the value of the cash holdings erode.
Inflation measures the average price change in a basket of commodities and services over time.
The opposite and rare fall in the price index of this basket of items is called ‘deflation’.
In India, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) measures inflation.
Some causes of inflation: Increase in demand, reduction in supply, demand-supply gap, excess circulation of money, increase in input costs, devaluation of currency, rise in wages, among others.

COBWEB PHENOMENON

Explains large scale fluctuations in the prices of Pulses in the Indian Market.
If prices were higher in the previous year, more farmers would sow pulses in the current year leading to its over-production and subsequent decline in the prices.
The lower prices in the current year disincentive the farmers from growing crops in the next cropping season, leading to underproduction and subsequent increase in the prices.





NOTE: This particular question came back in 2011, thus all the facts and data w.r.t. the question becomes irrelevant in present times. However, covering the Inflation topic holistically still stands very important both in terms of UPSC Prelims and Mains perspective.**

### Question 5

When the annual Union Budget is not passed by the Lok Sabha:

- (a) The Budget is modified and presented again
- (b) The Budget is referred to the Rajya Sabha for suggestions
- (c) The Union Finance Minister is asked to resign
- (d) The Prime Minister submits the resignation of Council of Ministers
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Union Budget/Annual Financial Statement/Provision of Resignation for PM/CoM
According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Finance Minister must present the Budget or annual financial statement each year. It is a statement of estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India that has to be laid before the Parliament in respect of every financial year.
Provision of Resignation for PM/CoM:

When the annual Union Budget is not passed by the Lok Sabha, the PM and Council of Ministers submits their resignation.
If the money bill has not been passed in Lok Sabha, it leads to the dissolution of Lok Sabha i.e. it questions the majority of the Lok Sabha and therefore the government needs to pass a confidence motion to prove the majority in the house.
The PM and the Council of Ministers resign if a Vote of No Confidence has been passed in the Lok Sabha.**

### Question 6

What is the difference between “vote-on-account” and “interim budget”?

1. The provision of a “vote-on-account” is used by a regular Government, while an “interim budget” is a provision used by a caretaker Government.

2. A “vote-on-account” only deals with the expenditure in the Government’s budget, while an “interim budget” includes both expenditure and receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Interim Budget vis-a-vis Vote On Account
Statement 1 is incorrect: During the time of approaching elections, it is not practical to present a full budget, therefore the government presents an interim budget. Interim Budget can be presented by all governments whether incumbent or regular or caretaker.
Statement 2 is correct: Vote-on-Account is a provision by which the government seeks Parliament’s approval for funds that are sufficient to bear the expenditure till the formation of a new government takes place. A vote-on-account contains only the expenditure of the government’s budget while an Interim Budget is a complete set of accounts i.e. it includes both expenditure and receipts.**

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Salient features of 73rd Amendment Act
Statement 1 is correct: The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act provides for a District Planning Committee to consolidate the plans prepared by Panchayats and Municipalities (Article 243ZD) not 73rd Amendment. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 added a new part IX to the Constitution of India. This part is entitled as “The Panchayats” and contains articles 243 to 243 O.
Statement 2 is correct: According to the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, the conduct of Panchayati Raj elections is vested in the state election commission consisting of a state election commissioner appointed by the Governor of the state.
Statement 3 is correct: 73rd Amendment Act also mandates for the establishment of State Finance Commissions.**

### Question 8

Consider the following statements:

In India, a Metropolitan Planning Committee

1. Is constituted under the provisions of the constitution of India.

2. Prepares the draft development plans for the metropolitan area.

3. Has the sole responsibility for implementing Government sponsored schemes in the metropolitan area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Metropolitan Planning Committee
Statement 1 is correct: Article 243 ZE of Part IX A provides for establishment of the Metropolitan  Planning  Committee  (MPC).
The Constitution under Article 243P mandates formation of Metropolitan Planning Committees (MPCs) in all metropolitan areas where population is above 10 Lakh. The elected officials of the municipalities and the heads of the panchayats in the metropolitan area elects 2/3rd of the MPC members from among themselves. 1/3rd is nominated. Elected members are proportionate to the rural: urban population ratio.
Statement 2 is correct: MPC prepares the draft development plans for the metropolitan area. Statement 3 is incorrect: MPC helps in draft planning and not in implementing the Govt sponsored schemes in the metropolitan area.



NOTE: In statement 3, after reading the extreme/absolute phrase “sole”, we can take the calculable risk of marking it as incorrect. This logic is also supported by reasoning that MPC is a “planning body” and statement 3 is talking about “implementation functions”.**

## Modern History

### Question 1

The tendency for increased litigation was visible after the introduction of the land settlement system of Lord Cornwallis in 1793. The reason for this is normally traced to which of the following provisions?

- (a) Making Zamindar’s position stronger vis-à-vis the ryot
- (b) Making East India Company an overlord of
- (c) Making judicial system more efficient
- (d) None of the (a), (b) and (c)
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Land Revenue Settlement
Reforms of Cornwallis:

The Permanent Land Revenue Settlement of Bengal, which was extended to the provinces of Bihar and Orissa, was Lord Cornwallis’ most notable administrative
The reforms had increased the litigation after the introduction of the land settlement system and the main reason for this was the removal of Court Fee and now everybody could drag anybody to the courts.
The extension to the right of appeal was also one of the reasons court fees were abolished by Cornwallis and Lawyers were prescribed their fees.
Zamindari System:



The Zamindari System was introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1793 through the Permanent Settlement Act 1793.
The land where the zamindars had previously been responsible for collecting revenue was given to them as ownership.
The settlement is referred to as the Zamindari Settlement since it was made with the zamindars.
Since they were regarded as the soil’s tillers, the ryots were made tenants.
The demand for land revenue was predetermined and out of controlled revenue, 10/11th part was given to the 
Company also added the “Sunset clause” for the zamindars.




NOTE: Many questions came from this particular theme esp. Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari Settlement, Mahalwari Settlement. So understanding differences between them stands crucial.**

### Question 3

What was the purpose for which Sir William Wedderburn and W.S. Caine had set up the Indian Parliamentary Committee in 1893?

- (a) To agitate for Indian political reforms in the House of Commons
- (b) To campaign for the entry of Indians into the Imperial Judiciary
- (c) To facilitate a discussion on India’s Independence in the British Parliament
- (d) To agitate for the entry of eminent Indians into the British Parliament
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Administrative Reform post-1857
Together with Dadabhai Naoroji and other supporters of India, Sir William Wedderburn and W.  S.  Caine established the “Indian Parliamentary Committee” in 1893. The Indian Parliamentary Committee’s mission is to lobby the House of Commons for political reforms in India.
About Sir William Wedderburn:

President of INC: 1838-1918 (Bombay, 1889, Allahabad, 1910)
He came to India in 1860 and registered for work as an Assistant Collector at Dharwad.
His interest in these issues led him to contact the Indian National Congress.
After retiring, Wedderburn threw himself into He presided over the fourth Congress held in Bombay in 1889.
Together with Dadabhai Naoroji and other supporters of India, Sir William Wedderburn and W. S. Caine established the “Indian Parliamentary Committee” in 1893. The Indian Parliamentary Committee’s mission is to lobby the House of Commons for political reforms in India.
In 1895, Wedderburn represented India on the Welby Commission (i.e. Royal Commission) on Indian Expenditure.
He also began participating in the activities of the Indian Famine Union set up in June 1901, for investigation into famines and proposing preventive measures.
He came to India in 1904 to attend the 20th session of the Indian National Congress in Bombay, which was presided over by Sir Henry Cotton.
He was again invited in 1910 to preside over the 25th session.
He remained the Chairman of the British Committee of the Congress from July 1889 until his death.





NOTE: By a general understanding of modern history, we know congress was established in 1885 and 1893 was a phase of early moderates and demands were mostly concentrated about reforms. Demand for India’s Independence came at a later stage. By this reasoning, we can eliminate option c.**

### Question 4

Which amongst the following provided a common factor for tribal insurrection in India in the 19th century?

- (a) Introduction of a new system of land revenue and taxation of tribal products
- (b) Influence of foreign religious missionaries in tribal areas
- (c) Rise of a large number of money lenders, traders and revenue farmers as middlemen in tribal areas
- (d) The complete disruption of the old agrarian order of the tribal communities
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Tribal Movement
The essence of Tribal life, i.e. shifting cultivation, hunting, fishing and the use of forest produce etc. was completely disrupted during the colonial rule.
Causes of Tribal Revolts in India in the 19th Century:

The cornerstone of Tribal life was shifting cultivation, hunting, fishing and the use of forest produce.
The practice of settled agriculture was established with the inflow of non-tribals into the traditional tribal lands and as a result of it the tribal population suffered a land loss.
There were restrictions imposed on the utilisation of forest products, shifting agriculture, and hunting methods. This led to the loss of livelihood for the tribals.
The tribals turned into landless agricultural laboures.
Money lenders were introduced by the British into the tribal regions, which greatly increased the exploitation of the native tribes. Under the new economic structure, they were reduced to bonded labour.
A joint ownership arrangement for land existed in tribal communities before the idea of private property took hold.
Tribal society has historically been egalitarian in contrast to mainstream society, which is characterised by caste and class However, with the arrival of non-tribals or outsiders, tribal people began to be seen as belonging to the lowest strata of society.
In order to manage the abundant riches of Indian forests, the government established a Forest Department in 1864. A comprehensive government monopoly on the forested land was created by the Govt Forest Act of 1865 and the Indian Forest Act of 1878.
The work of Christian missionaries also led to social unrest in tribal societies, which also aroused their resentment.
Major Tribal movements of 19th Century: Kol Rebellion (1832); Santhal Rebellion (1855-56); Munda Rebellion (1899-1900)




NOTE: option (d) sounds more inclusive and wider in coverage in terms of issues faced by tribals. It also includes the meaning and spirit of the above 3 sentences i.e. a, b, and c in one way or other. The options are ambiguous, hence we stuck to the official answer key of UPSC.**

### Question 5

What was the reason for Mahatma Gandhi to organize a satyagraha on behalf of the peasants of Kheda?

The Administration did not suspend the land revenue collection in spite of a drought.
The Administration proposed to introduce Permanent Settlement in Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Phase of Mahatma Gandhi
Statement 1 is correct: Kheda Satyagraha (1918) was  the first Non-cooperation Movement. Crops failed in Kheda district of Gujarat because of drought. The yield was less than 1/4th of normal produce so farmers were entitled to remission according to revenue code but the Government demanded taxes and ordered seizure of property, if not paid. Mahatma Gandhi asked the farmers not to pay the taxes and organise a satyagraha on behalf of the peasants. Leaders: Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Mohanlal Pandya, Narhari Parekh, etc. Government finally agreed to return all confiscated property, reduce the increase in tax, and suspend the tax for the year.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Permanent Settlement was introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1893 and it was confined in the areas of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Varanasi (United Provinces), Northern Karnataka. It was never introduced in Gujarat.**

### Question 6

With reference to the period of Indian freedom struggle, which of the following was/were recommended by the Nehru report?

Complete Independence for India.
Joint electorates for reservation of seats for minorities
Provision of fundamental right for the people of India in the constitution.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Nehru Report
Nehru Report (1928):
As an answer to Lord Birkenhead’s challenge, the Nehru report was prepared by a committee headed by Motilal Nehru, the committee included Tej Bahadur Sapru, Subhash Bose, M.S. Aney, Mangal Singh, Ali Imam, Shuab Qureshi and G.R. Pradhan as its members.
Recommendations:

Dominion status on lines of self- governing dominions. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.
Rejection of separate electorates. Joint electorates with reservation of seats for Muslims at the Centre and in provinces where they were in minority. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.
 Linguistic provinces.

Nineteen fundamental rights, including the rights to form unions, the right to equal treatment for women, and universal adult suffrage. Therefore, statement 3 is correct.
Responsible government at the Centre and in provinces.
Full protection of the cultural and religious interests of Muslims.
Complete dissociation of State from religion.
The three Indian Round Table Conference (1930–1932) attendees had access to both the Nehru Report and the Simon Commission report.
Nehru and Subash Bose rejected the congress goal and set up the Independence for India league.






NOTE: If we read NCERT of Modern India, we will come to know “Dominion Status” for India was the principal demand of the Nehru report. Just knowing this basic fact, we can eliminate option 1 and you will get the answer.**

- (a) It was a non-violent movement
- (b) It was led by Mahatma Gandhi
- (c) It was a spontaneous movement
- (d) It did not attract the labour class in general
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Quit India Movement
Quit India Movement/August Revolution (1942):

After failure of Cripps’s Mission, a Resolution was framed by Gandhiji for British withdrawal and non-violent Non- Cooperation Movement against Japanese
Resolution was accepted in the CWC meeting in Wardha on July 14, 1942.
AICC Gowalia Tank Meeting, Bombay:

The Quit India Resolution was ratified in a Congress meeting at Gowalia Tank on 8th August 1942.
Apart from QIM, other resolutions involved the Civil Disobedience Movement against British Rule.
Mantra of “Do or Die” was adopted in this Session by Gandhiji.
Major activity after QIM resolution was passed:
It was started in response to Mahatma Gandhi’s national appeal for satyagraha. Gandhiji advocated for “an orderly British withdrawal” from India as the All-India Congress Committee announced a nationwide protest.
Destruction of symbols of Public Authority.
Underground activities: Usha Sharma started an underground Radio to give fuel to the movement.
Yusuf Meherally, a communist and trade unionist who also held the office of Mayor of Mumbai, is credited with coining the phrase “Quit India.”
Parallel Government: established in Ballia (UP), Tamluk (Bengal) organised “Bidyut Bahini”, Satara (Maharashtra) “Prati Sarkar” was organised by Y. B. Chavan, Nana Patil etc.
 Youth, Women, Workers, Peasants, Government officials especially of lower levels, Muslims, Communists participated in the movement. Upper class remained Loyalists.
There were no communal clashes during the movement. But there was severe government repression with upto 10,000 being killed.


Option (a) is correct: The movement basically promoted the non-violent and non-cooperative movement.
Option (b) is incorrect: The British Govt responded to the call of Gandhi by arresting all major Congress leaders the very next day. Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, etc. were all behind the bars. This left the movement in the hands of the younger leaders like Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia, besides many regional leaders also rose up to lead this movement in their respective regions.
Option (c) is correct: The Quit India movement was the spontaneous participation of the masses compared to the other Gandhian movements like non-cooperation and civil disobedience.
Option (d) is correct: Quit India Movement did not attract the labour class in general.

## Science Technology

### Question 1

At present, scientists can determine the arrangement or relative positions of genes of DNA sequences on a chromosome. How does this knowledge benefit us?

It is possible to know the pedigree of
It is possible to understand the causes of all human diseases.
It is possible to develop disease-resistant animal

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: DNA sequences

DNA Sequencing means determining the order of the four chemical building blocks – called “bases” – that make up the DNA molecule. This sequence informs scientists the kind of genetic information that is carried in a particular DNA segment.
Statement 1 is correct: A thorough pedigree analysis using pedigree files received via DNA sequencing from the relevant breed organisations.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Sequencing enables medical professionals to identify whether a gene or the region that controls a gene includes alterations, known as variations or mutations, that are connected to an illness. But, through arrangement of genes of DNA sequences on a chromosome, it is not possible to understand the causes of all human diseases.
Statement 3 is correct: Researchers have even been able to identify specific faults in genes that are responsible for or contribute to disease. Hence, Breeds of animals that are resistant to disease can be created.**

### Question 2

Regular intake of fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended in the diet since they are a good source of antioxidants. How do antioxidants help a person maintain health and promote longevity?

- (a) They activate the enzymes necessary for vitamin synthesis in the body and help prevent vitamin deficiency
- (b) They prevent excessive oxidation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins in the body and help avoid unnecessary wastage of energy
- (c) They neutralize the free radicals produced in the body during metabolism
- (d) They activate certain genes in the cells of the body and help delay the ageing process
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Component of food/balanced diet
Option (c) is correct: The purpose of antioxidants is to counteract the harmful effects of free radicals in our body, thereby
promoting better health. By providing an electron to a roaming free radical, antioxidants have the ability to stabilize it, thus mitigating its potential to cause damage.
About Antioxidant:

Any substance that can inhibit the formation of unstable molecules known as free radicals, which harm DNA, cell membranes, and other components of cells, is referred to as a “antioxidant.”
Free radicals grab electrons from other molecules in order to complete their electron complement, which causes those molecules to suffer damage.
Free radicals are countered by antioxidants by sacrificing some of their own electrons. They serve as a natural “off” switch for the free radicals by making this sacrifice. Antioxidants neutralize the free radicals produced in the body during 
For example some vitamins and minerals — including vitamins C and E and the minerals copper, zinc, and selenium — serve as antioxidants, in addition to other vital roles.

Antioxidants can also be found in food, especially in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based, whole foods.**

### Question 5

An artificial satellite orbiting around the Earth does not fall down. This is so because the attraction of Earth

- (a) Does not exist at such distance
- (b) Is neutralized by the attraction of the moon
- (c) Provides the necessary speed for its steady motion
- (d) Provides the necessary acceleration for its motion
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Basic knowledge on space/ Universe/Gravitation
The Correct answer id Option (d):

Artificial satellites are launched into orbit for a variety of purposes, including communications, navigation, Earth imaging, weather observation, and scientific study.
In satellites, humans typically feel weightless. We experience a sense of weightlessness because the net force acting on our body is practically zero.This is due to the satellite’s centrifugal force, which cancels out the size of the earth’s gravitational pull.
On the other hand, the earth’s gravitational pull is required for the satellite to continuously change its direction, giving acceleration for the satellite’s direction- changing process.
When artificial satellites are sent into outer space, a huge velocity is applied to them to escape the earth’s gravitation At that point, they develop their own velocity and acceleration, with respect to the other forces acting on them to move in a path in accordance to earth’s revolution around the sun.**

### Question 6

Which is the difference between asteroids and comets?

Asteroids are small rocky planetoids, while comets are formed of frozen gases held together by rocky and metallic material.
Asteroids are found mostly between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, while comets are found mostly between Venus and Mercury.
Comets show a perceptible glowing tail, while asteroids do not.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 1 and 3 only
- (c) 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Basic knowledge on space/Universe

Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 6 billion years ago. They are sometimes called minor planets.
Comets are frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system composed of dust, rock, and ices. Their size ranges from a few miles to tens of miles wide, and as they orbit closer to the Sun, they heat up and spew gases and dust into a glowing head that can be larger than a planet.
This material forms a tail that stretches millions of miles.
The main asteroid belt, which extends between Mars and Jupiter, is home to the majority of this old space debris. Asteroids range in size from the largest, Vesta, which has a diameter of roughly 329 miles (530 kilometres), to bodies that are about 33 feet (10 metres) wide. The cumulative mass of all asteroids is less than that of the moon of Earth.
Comets are solar system-orbiting snowballs made of frozen gases, rock, and dust.
They enlarge to the size of a sizable town when frozen.
A comet heats up and ejects dust and gases into a huge, blazing head that is larger than most planets when its orbit puts it near to the Sun.
Millions of kilometres away from the Sun, the dust and gas combine to form a The Kuiper Belt and much further Oort Cloud are presumably home to billions of comets that orbit our Sun.
Comets are not limited to the belt between Mercury and Venus.
Statement 1 is correct: Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. Comets are frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system composed of dust, rock, and ices.
Statement 2 is incorrect and 3 is correct: When a comet’s orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. Also, comets are not restricted to the belt between Mercury and Venus.**

Geostationary Orbit

Geostationary Orbit is a type of geosynchronous orbit.
The earth rotates in the same direction that satellites do. It lasts for roughly 24 hours and holds its place in relation to the earth.
Low earth orbit, medium earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit, geostationary orbit, etc. are several categories for circular orbits. Thus, communications satellites are positioned in elliptical orbits.
Geostationary orbits are in the same plane as the equator as opposed to geosynchronous satellites, which can have any inclination.
Geostationary orbit lies at an altitude of about 36000 km.
Statement 1 is correct: Geostationary Orbit is one type of geosynchronous orbit only Statement 2 is correct: Circular orbits are classified into low earth orbit, medium earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit, geostationary orbit etc. Hence telecommunication satellites are placed in circular orbits.
Statement 3 is correct: While geosynchronous satellites can have any inclination, geostationary orbits lie on the same plane as the equator.
Statement 4 is incorrect: Geostationary orbit is at an altitude of around 36000 km.**

### Question 8

The surface of a lake is frozen in severe winter, but the water at its bottom is still liquid. What is the reason?

- (a) Ice is a bad conductor of heat
- (b) Since the surface of the lake is at the same temperature as the air, no heat is lost
- (c) The density of water is maximum at 4°C
- (d) None of the statements (a), (b) and (c) given above is correct
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Basic and Everyday Science
The Correct answer is Option (c): About Water:

Water attains maximum density at
The cold water at the top sinks to the bottom when water at a temperature higher than this is cooled from above, allowing warmer water to be cooled.
Nevertheless, this alters as the temperature reaches 4°C. The cold water condenses on the surface and selectively cools until it turns to ice. Because of how well this ice retains heat, it “protects” the warmer water beneath it from freezing.
But depending on the temperature of the atmosphere, the thickness of the ice layer would change.**

- (c) Cool down the reactor
- (d) Stop the nuclear reaction
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Nuclear Energy
The Correct answer is Option (a): About Heavy Water:

Moderator is used in a Nuclear reactor for slowing down the neutrons produced during the fission reaction so that the chain reaction can be sustained.
Due to its high moderating ratio and low neutron absorption cross section, heavy water makes a good moderator. Deuterium oxide, popularly known as heavy water (D2O), is a hydrogen isotope with a mass double that of regular hydrogen and It is a component of water.
In nuclear power reactors, heavy water is utilised as a coolant and a neutron moderator.



•   Components of a nuclear reactor:
0 Fuel – which is generally Uranium
0 Moderator – It is used to slow down the neutrons released from fission to create more fission. Generally, water, heavy water or graphite is used for this purpose.
0 Control rods or blades – They are basically made with neutron absorbing material such as cadmium, hafnium, boron and are inserted from the core to control the rate of reaction.
0 Coolant- It is a fluid circulating through the core so as to transfer the heat from it.
0  Pressure vessel or pressure tubes
– It is usually a robust steel vessel containing the reactor core and moderator or coolant but it may be a series of tubes holding the fuel and conveying the coolant through the surrounding moderator.
0 Steam generator – It is the part of the cooling system of pressurized water reactors where the high pressure primary coolant brings heat from the reactor.**
