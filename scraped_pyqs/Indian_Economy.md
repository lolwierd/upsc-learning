Secondary


2.
Dairy farm
Primary


3.
Mineral exploration
Tertiary


4.
Weaving cloth
Secondary

How many of the pairs given above are correctly matched?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   Only three
- (d)   All four
Explanation


**Ans:  b
Exp:  

Primary : It forms the base for all other products that we subsequently make. Since most of the natural products we get are from agriculture, dairy, fishing, forestry, this sector is also called agriculture and related sector. Ex: Dairy farm
Secondary : It covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. It is the next step after primary. The product is not produced by nature but has to be made and therefore some process of manufacturing is essential. This could be in a factory, a workshop or at home.  For example, using cotton fibre from the plant, we spin yarn and weave cloth. Using sugarcane as a raw material, we make sugar or gur.
Tertiary :  These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns (i.e. Storage of Agriculture produce).
Quaternary: Mineral Exploration**

Fixed Capital :  Fixed capital can be thought of as physical investments in producing a good that can be used on several occasions or at least multiple accounting periods. Since it is fixed and reusable (e.g., buildings and machinery), it cannot readily be converted to cash. Although it is not consumed during the manufacturing process, it has a long-term value that can fluctuate and, in most cases, deteriorate with time. For example: Farmers Plough and Computer.
Working Capital:  Working capital refers to a company’s liquid assets, such as cash and inventory in hand, or anything that can be swiftly changed into currency. This type of capital is used during the production of the final product. For example: Yarn used by the weaver and Petrol.**

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?
(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I
(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect
(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct

Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) are infrastructure developer-sponsored Trusts that own, operate, and invest in completed and under- construction infrastructure projects. These infrastructure assets include roads and highways, power distribution networks, telecom towers, fiber
optic networks, etc.
Statement I is not correct: Any dividend or interest income that you get from an InvIT is completely taxable as per your Income Tax Slab rate. This income has to be declared every year in your Income Tax Return under the head “Income from Other Sources”. So if you are in the highest Income Tax bracket, you may have to pay 30% tax on any dividends or interest that you receive from an InvIT. Capital Gains taxation rules are applicable only if you sell your InvITs units. If you have stayed invested in InvITs for up to 3 years prior to the sale, Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) taxation rules are applicable.
Statement II is correct: InvITs and REITs now recognised as borrowers under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest (SARFAESI) Act and lenders to these trusts have adequate statutory enforcement options, absence of which was earlier becoming a constraint for bankers to lend directly at trust level. Insurance regulatory and development authority of India (IRDAI) has recently allowed insurers to invest in debt instruments of InvITs and REITs rated AA and above as a part of their approved investments, which shows growing comfort of lenders as well as investors around such structures.
Hence, Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct.**

Statement II is correct: Central banks use monetary policy to manage economic fluctuations and achieve price stability, may it be inflation or deflation. Central banks conduct monetary policy by adjusting the supply of money, usually through buying or selling securities in the open market. Open market
operations affect short-term interest rates, which in turn influence longer-term rates and economic activity. When central banks lower interest rates, monetary policy is easing. When they raise interest rates, monetary policy is tightening. Hence, Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct
and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I.**

### Question 3

Which one of the following activities of the Reserve Bank of India is considered to be part of ‘sterilization’?

(b) Oversight of settlement and payment systems
(c) Debt and cash management for the Central and State Governments
(d) Regulating the functions of Non-banking Financial Institutions

Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp: 
Sterilization is a form of monetary action in which a central bank seeks to limit the effect of inflows and outflows of capital on the money supply. Sterilization
most frequently involves the purchase or sale of financial assets by a central bank which is known as Open Market Operations and is designed to offset the effect of foreign exchange intervention. The sterilization process is used to manipulate the value of one domestic currency relative to another and is initiated in the foreign exchange market. It is used by central banks in order to stem the negative effects emerging from capital inflows or outflows from a country’s economy. For example, a U.S. investor looking to invest in India must use dollars to purchase rupees. If a lot of U.S. investors start buying up rupees,
the rupee exchange rate will increase. At this point, the Indian central bank can either let the fluctuation continue, which can drive up the price of Indian exports, or it can buy foreign currency with its reserves in order to drive down the exchange rate.**

A company extends loans, technical knowledge and material inputs to a number of small farmers in an area so that they produce the agricultural commodity required by the company for its manufacturing process and commercial production

Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp:
About ‘Small Farmer Large Field’: 

Collective action model “Small Farmers Large Field (SFLF)” has overcome the disadvantages faced by millions of small and marginal farmers due to diseconomies of scale and lack of bargaining power in the supply chain.
This model is participatory and flexible and allows small farmers to benefit from achieving economies of scale by organizing themselves into groups and synchronizing and harmonizing selected operations. The basics of the model are that small land holders (Marginal Farmers) join and decide to grow a crop of one or two varieties, synchronize all the agricultural operations (seed to seed) as a group/ community and gain higher bargaining power while dealing with service providers, dealers, and paddy traders/millers. The overall findings from the project are- reduced cost of production of paddy, increased grain yield, comparatively higher price over prevailed market price, enhanced farmers’ gross income and net profit. The standard criteria to develop SFLF on a multi- stakeholder partnership are:

Horizontal coordination of small rice farmers – Smallholders are reorganized and integrated in groups to increase their power.
Vertical coordination of farmers with input dealers at one end and output market at the other end.**

The tribal population uses niger seed oil for cooking, the press cake post oil-extraction as livestock feed, and also consume the seeds as a condiment. Some features of the Niger seed are:

Niger seed oil has medicinal properties, which is the reason for its commercial demand by the cosmetics, perfumeries and other allied industries.
Besides, the crop can grow on denuded soil and its cultivation method is fairly basic: After the first rain when the soil is moist, farmers need to plough the field and sprinkle the seeds.
The crop neither requires much water nor fertilisers and pesticides.

About Minimum Support Price:

It is the lowest rate at which government procurement agencies buy crops from farmers. It shields farmers from market fluctuations, offering stability and income security.
It is determined by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), considering factors like production costs, market trends, and demand-supply dynamics.
After the CACP submits its recommendations, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister of India, makes the final decision on MSP levels.
CACP is established in 1965 and operates under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.**

About Beta:

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between the expected return and risk of investing in a security. It shows
that the expected return on a security is equal to the risk-free return plus a risk premium, which is based on the beta of that security. The beta is a numeric value that is a measure of a stock’s risk (volatility of returns) reflected by measuring the fluctuation of its price changes relative to the overall market. In other words, it is the stock’s sensitivity to market risk. For instance, if a company’s beta is equal to 1.5 the security has 150% of the volatility of the market average. However, if the beta is equal to 1, the expected return on a security is equal to the average market return. A beta of -1 means security has a
perfect negative correlation with the market.**

About Self-Help Groups (SHGs):

The Self-Help Group (SHG) programme was originally initiated by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and began extensively marketing self-help groups in 1991–1992. It served as the actual launchpad for the “SHG movement.” The Reserve Bank of India also permitted SHGs to open savings accounts in banks in 1993. Hence, Statement-I is not correct.

In an SHG, all members of a group take responsibility for a loan that an individual member takes. Additionally, they use group leadership and conversations to resolve disputes. Hence, Statement-II is correct.
The Regional Rural Banks and Scheduled Commercial Banks support SHGs. Indian financial institutions known as Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are created with the purpose of offering banking services to rural communities. They are governed by the RBI and structured as scheduled commercial banks. Small enterprises and rural entrepreneurship have received backing from RRBs, which has helped create jobs in rural areas.

### Question 1

With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:

1. If the inflation is too high, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to buy government securities.

2. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, RBI is likely to sell dollars in the market.

3. If interest rates in the USA or European Union were to fall, that is likely to induce RBI to buy dollars.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Qualitative Tools to control
Statement 1 is incorrect: If the inflation is too high, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to reduce the money supply in the economy to control inflation. Thus, RBI sells the government securities so as to suck the excess money supply from the economy and to control the inflation.
Statement 2 is correct: RBI intervenes in the currency market to support the rupee because if it becomes a weak domestic unit then it can increase a country’s import bill. It can intervene directly in the currency market by buying and selling dollars. If RBI wishes to prop up rupee value, then it can sell dollars and when it needs to bring down rupee value, it can buy dollars.
Statement 3 is correct: When the US raises its domestic interest rates, this tends to make India less attractive for the currency trade. As a result, it pulls some money from the Indian market out and flows back to the US, thereby decreasing the value of India’s currency against the US dollar. Therefore, if interest rates in the USA or EU were to fall, then it is likely to induce RBI to buy dollars.**

**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Exchange Rate
Statement 1 is correct: NEER is the Weighted average of bilateral nominal exchange rates of the home currency in terms of foreign currencies. The nominal exchange rate is the amount of domestic currency needed to purchase foreign currency. Therefore, an increase/decrease in NEER indicates the appreciation/depreciation of Rupee against the weighted basket of currencies of its trading partners.
Statement 2 is incorrect: REER is the weighted average of nominal exchange rates adjusted for relative price differential between the domestic and foreign countries. Therefore, an increase in a nation’s REER is an indication that its exports are becoming more expensive and its imports are becoming cheaper, which simply means it is losing trade competitiveness.
Statement 3 is correct: A real effective exchange rate (REER) is the NEER adjusted by relative prices or costs, typically captured in inflation differentials between the home economy and trading partners. Higher the inflation higher will be divergence (difference between) NEER and REER.**

Sub-Theme: Monetary Policy and External Commercial Borrowings
Statement 1 is correct: A tight monetary policy is implemented to contract economic growth. It involves increasing interest rates to constrain borrowing and to stimulate savings, this can discourage investment and depress asset prices. It makes borrowing less attractive as interest payment increases. Thus, tight monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve could lead to capital flight by the investors.
Statement 2 is correct: Capital flight can drive up the interest costs as there is reduced money supply in the system. Thus, it would lead to increase in the interest cost of firms that have external commercial borrowings.
Statement 3 is incorrect: ECB is basically a loan availed by an Indian entity from a non-resident lender in foreign currency whereas Devaluation is decreasing the value of currency within a fixed exchange rate system. Therefore, devaluation of the domestic currency would increase the currency risks associated with ECBs and will result in higher interest cost for borrowers.

**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Types of Inflation
Demand-pull inflation is caused by an increase in demand and when the demand in the economy outgrows the supply in the economy. It can be summed up as a condition of “too much money chasing too few goods”. With reference to the Indian economy, demand- pull inflation can be caused/increased by the following:

Expansionary Policies: Money in the market rises when the government spends more freely. It leads to an increase in demand for the goods and fuels demand- pull inflation.
Fiscal Stimulus: It also increases the money in the market which leads to an increase in demand for the goods and fuels demand- pull inflation.
Inflation-Indexing Wages: It means wages are linked to the inflation which means wages move as inflation changes in the economy. Such indexing is provided to reduce the effect of inflation on wages. It can not lead to demand pull inflation in the
Higher Purchasing Power: Consumers feel more confidence and spend more when they have a better income. As a result, demand increases, driving up inflation.
Rising Interest Rates: It will reduce the money supply in the market. Borrowing money will become costlier, creating a credit crunch in the economy. So, it cannot cause demand to pull inflation in the economy.

Additional Information:

Effective change in the wages is zero and it does not increase/decrease purchasing power. So, it cannot lead to a demand to pull inflation in the economy.
Rising interest rates decrease the money supply in the economy. Also, due to this borrowing money becomes costly. So, it cannot cause demand-pull inflation in the**

- (b) 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3
- (d) 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: RBI
Option (b) is correct: In India, the central bank’s function as the ‘lender of last resort’ usually refers to providing liquidity to banks that are facing temporary financial difficulties and are unable to meet their obligations. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can lend money to these banks, either directly or through other channels, to help them meet their short-term liquidity needs and avoid a crisis. This function is important for maintaining financial stability in the banking system and ensuring that banks can continue to serve their customers even in times of stress.
Lender of Last Resort

A “lender of last resort” means that the RBI (also called banker of banks) offers loans to banks or other eligible institutions that are experiencing financial difficulty or are considered highly risky or near collapse.
This helps to protect individuals who have deposited funds and to prevent customers from withdrawing out of panic from banks with temporarily limited liquidity.
Commercial banks usually try not to borrow from the “lender of last resort” e. RBI because such action indicates that the bank is experiencing a financial crisis.**

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2
- (c) 3 only
- (d) 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: BoP
Statement 1 is correct: Devaluation is decreasing the value of currency within a fixed exchange rate system. Exports become cheaper to foreign customers. Thus, it improves the competitiveness of domestic exports in the foreign markets.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Devaluation of a currency decreases the foreign value of the domestic currency. Example- Let us assume that the prevailing exchange rate of $1 is 20 Rs. So currently 1 Rs is worth $0.05. If the devaluation of currency is done and now the exchange rate of $1 is 50 Rs, this means 1 Rs is worth $0.02. So, the value of domestic currency (Rs) is decreased in terms of value of foreign currency ($).
Statement 3 is incorrect: Balance of Trade (BOT) is the difference between the value of exports and imports of a country in a given period of time. When foreign loans are valued in the native currency, devaluation also raises the debt burden on those loans. Devaluation might not, then, ultimately lead to an improvement in the trade balance. Hence, statements 3 is incorrect.**

Select the correct answer using the code given below.

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d          
Sub-Theme: Debt Instrument
Statement 1 is correct: Bond yield is the return an investor gets on that bond or on a particular government security. It depends on the price of the bond which is impacted by its demand. The actions of the US federal reserve can impact the investments flowing in India. This will lead to a decrease in demand for Government Securities (G-sec) and thus impacting its yield.
Statement 2 is correct: The actions of RBI directly impacts the bond yield because it is directly related to liquidity in the market which is controlled by RBI through various tools.
Statement 3 is correct: The purchasing capacity of an economy is directly related to inflation. So any change in short term rates will impact the demand and price of G-sec and thereby influencing the yield.**

Public Investment: It is an investment by the State (Central, state and local governments orthrough publicly owned companies) to build the nation’s capital stock by devoting resources to the basic physical infrastructure (such as roads, bridges, rail lines, airports, and water distribution), research and development, etc. that leads to increased output and/or living standards.
The following can be considered as Public Investment in Agriculture.

Computerization of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies: Computerization of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies will enhance productivity in the agricultural sector, as there will be easy and timely access of credit.
Social Capital Development: Building social capital for smallholders can also positively impact the adoption of new technologies such as the use of improved seeds, soil and water conservation practices, and agroforestry.
Setting up cold storage facilities by the governments: Setting up cold storage facilities will enhance productivity in the agricultural sector as agricultural products are generally perishable in nature and the facility of cold storage may help in increasing the shelf life of the products.

Additional Information:

Fixing Minimum Support Price for Agriculture for agricultural products of all crops and free electricity supply to farmers are subsidies, hence they are not categorized as public investment in agriculture.
Subsidies and incentives are not considered as public investment.**

### Question 5

Under the Kisan Credit Card scheme, short-term credit support is given to farmers for which of the following purposes?

Working capital for maintenance of farm assets
Purchase of combine harvesters, tractors and mini trucks.

Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Agricultural credit
Announced in the 1998–1999 budget, the Kisan Credit Card Scheme aims to provide farmers with the institutional credit they need to meet their financial needs at various phases of farming. It is implemented by all public sector banks, regional rural banks, and cooperative banks across the nation. Under the Kisan Credit Card scheme, short-term credit support is given to farmers for the following purposes:

Working Capital for Maintenance of Farm Assets: To provide Working capital for maintenance of farm assets and activities allied to agriculture.
Consumption Requirement of Farm Households: To fulfill the consumption requirements of farmers is one of the main objectives of KCS.
Post Harvest Expenses: Supporting the farmer in their post-harvest expenses.

Additional Information:

The Kisan Credit Cards are issued to the farmers so that they may use them to purchase agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. and draw cash for their production needs.
Construction of a family house is covered under PMAY and setting up a village cold storage facility is not covered under KCC





NOTE: Statement 2 talks about “Purchase of combine harvesters, tractors and mini trucks” which is not a short term investment. It needs heavy capital and is not possible with short-term credit support provided under KCC. By this reasoning and general understanding if we eliminate statement 2, we will get correct answer i.e., ‘Option (b) 1, 3 and 4 only’**

Open ended procurement means whatever foodgrains are offered by the farmers, within the stipulated procurement period and which conforms to the quality specifications prescribed by Government of India, are purchased at MSP (and bonus/ incentive, if any) by the Government agencies including FCI for central Pool.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Market price has no link with minimum support price and it can go below or above the MSP, depending upon the demand of the crop in the market.**

### Question 10

If another global financial crisis happens in the near future, which of the following actions/policies are most likely to give some immunity to India?

Opening up to more foreign banks
Maintaining full capital account convertibility

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Mechanism to counter Financial crisis
Statement 1 is correct: Due to the global economic crisis, both creditor and debtor nations face hardships to keep the economy afloat. Various  political and economic considerations make it difficult to come to the rescue of a distressed nation. Hence India should not depend on short term borrowings.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Opening up to more foreign banks would lead to enhanced exposure to the global economy, and hence an increased risk. Strengthening the domestic banks would prove more helpful in a situation like a global economic crisis.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Capital account convertibility means no restriction on the amount you can convert into foreign currency to enable you to acquire any foreign assets and vice versa. In a situation of a financial crisis, it will be a big mistake. It can create a situation of “Capital flight” where a foreign investor can withdraw all his money at once.**

It was a major aim of land reforms to provide agricultural land to all the landless.
The Objectives of the Land Reforms are as follows:

Removing institutional discrepancies of the agrarian structure.
Providing agricultural land to all the landless.
Issues of socio-economic inequality.
In order to address the interconnected issues of poverty, hunger, and food insecurity, agricultural productivity must be increased.

### Question 6

Consider the following statements:

1. Coal sector was nationalised by the Government of India under Indira Gandhi.

2. Now, coal blocks are allocated on lottery basis.

3. Till recently, India imported coal to meet the shortages of domestic supply, but now India is self-sufficient in coal products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Coal Sector
Statement 1 is correct: The nationalisation was done in two phases, the first with the coking coal mines in 1971-72 and then with the non -coking coal mines in 1973. Indira Gandhi served as the Prime Minister of the country from 1971-1973.
Statement 2 is incorrect: After the Supreme Court cancelled the coal block allocations in 2014. To manage and reallocate the cancelled blocks in a transparent and accountable manner, the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 enabled the provisions for ‘allocation of coal mines by way of auction and allotment for the sale of coal’.
Statement 3 is incorrect: India has the 5th largest coal reserves in the world, but due to the monopolies of some firms, it cannot produce enough coal to meet the shortages. It imports coal to meet the shortages. Domestic coal has been able to meet only 75% of our annual coal demand. About 200 mt of imports are used to make up for the shortage of local coal supply.




NOTE: Even if we don’t know the exact answer, we can still attempt the questions through elimination method. For example, observing the third statement, ‘self sufficient in coal products’ sounds absurd. Now if we have covered daily newspapers and NCERTs (geography) then we know that India holds the 5th biggest coal reserves in the world but due to incapacity of coal production by monopolistic firms, it imports coal to meet the shortages of domestic supply.
Hence, statement 3 is wrong and by eliminating this single statement we can arrive at the correct answer.**

- (b) The opportunity cost is ignored.
- (c) The opportunity costs are transferred from the consumers of the product to the tax-paying
- (d) The opportunity cost is transferred from the consumers of the product to the Government.
Explanation


**Ans: c        
Sub-Theme: Opportunity Cost
Opportunity cost represents the benefits an individual, investor, or business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. If a commodity is provided free to the public by the Government, then the opportunity cost is transferred from the consumers of the product to the tax-paying public. As per microeconomics, the opportunity cost is zero for free goods such as air and common goods such as fish/grazing land. For public goods such as street lights and defence, the opportunity cost is involved (The government could have spent that much money on street lights rather than on the military). So, the opportunity cost is not zero. Opportunity cost is also called Economic cost.**

Blue Box: This is the “amber box with conditions” – conditions designed to reduce distortion. Any support that would normally be in the amber box, is placed in the blue box if the support also requires farmers to limit production by imposing production quotas. It is an exemption from the general rule that all subsidies linked to production must be reduced or kept within defined minimal levels.
Green Box: Subsidies that do not distort trade or at most cause minimal distortions are placed in Green Box. These subsidies have to be government- funded (not by charging consumers higher prices) and must not involve price support.**

- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2

Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Economic Growth
Statement 1 is incorrect: Real Gross Domestic Product is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy in a given year (expressed in base-year prices). Real GDP makes comparing GDP from year to year and from different years more meaningful because it shows comparisons for both the quantity and value of goods and services. Rate of growth of Real Gross Domestic Product has fluctuated a lot during the last decade and decreased significantly in 2008-09 due to the global financial crisis.
Statement 2 is correct: Gross domestic product at market prices is the sum of added values of all activities which produce goods and services, plus taxes and minus subsidies on products. Its objective is to determine the total wealth generated by both private and public agents in a nation’s territory over a specific time frame. The most important component of national accounts, it shows the outcome of productive activity carried out by local producing units. Gross Domestic Product at market prices (in rupees) has increased and did not show a declining trend even once during the last decade as clearly seen from the planning commission data.




NOTE: India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 7.3% in 2020-21. However, between the early 1990s until the pandemic hit the country, India grew at an average of around 7% every year. The question was asked in 2015 and hence, the explanation is provided accordingly.**

Example: Salaries, wages, pensions, subsidies, and interest payments etc. The government incurs revenue expenses to meet its operating demands. Reducing the revenue expenditure will certainly help in bridging the gap.
Statement 3 is correct: Subsidies are a part of expenditure and rationalizing them would reduce the deficit.

Such liquidity ranges from assets readily available to resources that become available only after extensive negotiation. Gold and those foreign currencies that are accepted everywhere for the settlement of international transactions are the main sources of international liquidity. This problem of international liquidity exists essentially for developing countries.**

Venture Capital:

Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity and a type of financing that investors provide to startup companies and small businesses that are believed to have long- term growth potential.
The majority of venture capital is often provided by wealthy individuals, investment banks, and other financial organisations. However, it is not always in the form of money; it can also come in the form of managerial or technological know-how.
Venture capital is often given to startups with outstanding growth potential or to businesses that have had rapid growth and seem well-positioned to keep growing.
The possibility of above-average profits is an alluring payout, even though it might be risky for investors who put up money.
Venture capital is gradually becoming a popular—even necessary—source for obtaining funds for new businesses or projects with a brief working history (under two years), especially if they do not have access to capital markets, bank loans, or other debt instruments.
The main downside is that the investors usually get equity in the company, and, thus, a say in company decisions.**

- (b) Borrowing from the public to finance a budget deficit
- (c) Borrowings from banks to finance a budget deficit
- (d) Creating new money to finance a budget deficit
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Inflation
Option (d) is correct: Borrowing from banks to finance a budget deficit and Borrowing from the public to finance a budget deficit will lead to a decrease in the money supply in the market.

Budget Deficit:

It refers to a situation where total expenditure exceeds the total revenue.
A tool for raising money to create a budget deficit is known as deficit financing.
There are three ways to finance a budget:

Creating new currency
Borrowing from internal sources like RBI, issuing bonds, etc.
Borrowing from External sources like WB, IMF, etc.

Inflation:

It is the rise in prices of goods and services within a particular economy wherein, the purchasing power of consumers decreases, and the value of the cash holdings erode.
Inflation measures the average price change in a basket of commodities and services over time.
The opposite and rare fall in the price index of this basket of items is called ‘deflation’.
In India, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) measures inflation.
Some causes of inflation: Increase in demand, reduction in supply, demand-supply gap, excess circulation of money, increase in input costs, devaluation of currency, rise in wages, among others.

COBWEB PHENOMENON

Explains large scale fluctuations in the prices of Pulses in the Indian Market.
If prices were higher in the previous year, more farmers would sow pulses in the current year leading to its over-production and subsequent decline in the prices.
The lower prices in the current year disincentive the farmers from growing crops in the next cropping season, leading to underproduction and subsequent increase in the prices.





NOTE: This particular question came back in 2011, thus all the facts and data w.r.t. the question becomes irrelevant in present times. However, covering the Inflation topic holistically still stands very important both in terms of UPSC Prelims and Mains perspective.**
