### Question 1

Which one of the following is a work attributed to playwright Bhasa?

- (a)   Kavyalankara
- (b)   Natyashastra
- (c)   Madhyama-vyayoga
- (d)   Mahabhashya
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Bhasa — one of the earliest Indian playwrights — straddles between two worlds in his celebrated work, Madhyama Vyayoga . He is within the epic and outside of it. Bhasa picks characters from the epic Mahabharatha – Ghatotkacha, Bhima and Hidimba, and weaves it with the story of a Brahmin, taken from a Vedic text. In doing so, Bhasa is creatively liberated from the epic, as also from the Vedic text. This conjunction also makes it possible for Bhasa to gain an interpretive freedom: he thereby bestows upon these epic figures, a new dimension. Ghatokacha is not a cruel demon and Brahmin hater as he is in the epic, Hidimba is no mere mountain of strength and a brutal demoness, and Bhima is not all show of strength**

In many instances, UPSC gave an extreme and exclusive statement as the correct one. So choose options logically and wisely.

It is more commonly known as the ‘earth witness’ mudra.
This mudra, formed with all five fingers of the right hand extended to touch the ground, symbolises the Buddha’s enlightenment under the bodhi tree, when he summoned the earth goddess, Sthavara, to bear witness to his attainment of enlightenment.
The right hand, placed upon the right knee in earth-pressing mudra, and complemented by the left hand-which is held flat in the lap in the dhyana mudra of meditation, symbolises the union of method and wisdom, samsara and nirvana, and also the realisations of the conventional and ultimate truths.
It is in this posture that Shakyamuni overcomes the obstructions of Mara while meditating on Truth.
The second Dhyani Buddha Akshobhya is depicted in this mudra.
He is believed to transform the delusion of anger into mirror-like wisdom.**
