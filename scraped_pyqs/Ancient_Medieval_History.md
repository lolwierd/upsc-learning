> Explanation:

Pair 1 is incorrectly matched: : Chandraketugarh is an urban centre of the ancient state of Gangaridai belonging to the trans-Bengal region at the interface of West Bengal and Bangladesh. The description has been found from various travelogues from India and abroad. The position of Chandraketugarh has been acknowledged on the basis of Maritime-Land route memoirs and textual historic evidences obtained from within India and also from the eastern and western parts of Asia. The antiquity of the area dates back to eras as early as 4th century BCE, a period much prior to the Mauryan era and shows evidence in the continuity of subsequent Sunga, Kushana, Gupta, Pala and Sena dynasties.

Pair 2 is correctly matched: Inamgaon is a chalcolithic site in Maharashtra. After the disintegration of the Indus civilization, in a phase known as the Early Jorwe (1400– 1000 BC), hundreds of agrarian villages flourished in the Deccan region of west-central India. Environmental degradation, combined with unsustainable agricultural practices, contributed to the abandonment of many communities around 1000 BC. Inamgaon was one of a handful of villages to persist into the Late Jorwe phase (1000–700 BC), wherein reliance on dry-plough agricultural production declined.

- (d) Muhammad Shah
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Amidst increasing Portuguese threats to Gujarat’s trade and coastal regions, the Sultan of Gujarat sought Ottoman support, leading to a continuous exchange of embassies and letters between the two powers. The Ottomans ousted the Portuguese from the Red Sea and dispatched a fleet to aid Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. Rumi Khan, an Ottoman commander, successfully repelled Portuguese attacks on Daman and Diu in 1531. However, a larger threat emerged
from the Mughals, leading Bahadur Shah to grant Bassein to the Portuguese. As part of the defensiveoffensive alliance against the Mughals, the Portuguese
were granted permission to construct a fort at Diu, thereby solidifying their presence in Gujarat.
Krishna’s Explanation:
The Portuguese had already mounted a clear and strategic presence in Mumbai long before the arrival of the British in India. After its takeover of Goa in 1510, the maritime power set about consolidating its presence in north Konkan, attempting several incursions on the islands of Bombay and Mahim,
governed at the time by the Sultans of Gujarat. In 1526, the Portuguese established a factory at Bassein. In 1528-29 they seized the fort of Mahim. With the
largest fleet at their command, the Portuguese under Goa’s Viceroy Nuno da Cunha had become a nagging maritime presence for Sultan Bahadur Shah of
Gujarat. Wary of the growing power of the Mughals, Bahadur Shah chose to strike up an alliance with the Portuguese. In 1534 he signed off the seven islands of Bombay and the strategic town of Bassein to the Portuguese in a treaty of peace and commerce, bringing to an end Islamic rule on the Islands. Also, as a part of the defensive-offensive alliance against the Mughals, the Portuguese were granted permission to construct a fort at Diu, thereby solidifying their presence in Gujarat.**

Ashoka appointed representatives, referred to as the dhamma mahamatta, who travelled  around  instructing  people  about dhamma. Ashoka had his messages inscribed on pillars and rocks, and he ordered his officials to read his messages to people who were unable to do so for themselves.

### Question 1

With reference to the difference between the culture of Rigvedic Aryans and Indus Valley people, which of the following statements is/are correct?

Rigvedic Aryans knew gold, silver and copper whereas Indus Valley people knew only copper and iron.
Rigvedic Aryans had domesticated the horse whereas there is no evidence of Indus Valley people having been aware of this animal.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Significant features and lifestyle aspect of Aryans viz-a-viz Indus Valley Civilization
Statement 1 is correct: For offensive weapons, the Vedic-Aryans have the bow and arrow, spear, dagger, and axe, and for defensive armour the helmet and coat of mail. The Indus people also have the bow and arrow, spear, dagger and axe, but defensive armour is quite unknown to Indus valley people.
Statement 2 is incorrect: The metals which the Indo-Aryans used in the time of the Rigveda are gold and copper or bronze; but a little later, these metals are supplemented by silver and iron. Among the Indus people, silver is more common than gold, and utensils and vessels are sometimes made of stone – a relic of the Neolithic Age – as well as of copper and bronze. Statement 3 is correct: The horse seems to have been unknown to the inhabitants of Mohenjo-Jo-Daro and Harappa. But Many references have been made regarding the Surkotada site containing horse remains dated to 2000 BCE, which is considered a significant observation with respect to Indus Valley Civilisation. After evaluating the Surkotada bone fragments, Sándor Bökönyi (1997) concluded that at least six of the samples most likely belonged to the real horse. However, this is not definitive proof, and it does not imply that people in the Indus Valley knew about horses.

- (a) Shramana
- (b) Parivraajaka
- (c) Agrahaarika
- (d) Magadha
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Terminologies based on ancient India
The Correct answer is Option (d): About Buddhism and Jainism: Buddhism and Jainism emerged as prominent religions having a large number of followers, referred to as Sramanic religions; these two religious systems were antithetical to the mainstream Vedic religion. During its development, the term came to refer to several non-Brahmanical ascetic religions parallel to but separate from the Vedic religion. The Sramaṇa tradition includes primarily Jainism, Buddhism, and others such as the Ajivika. The Sramaṇa religions became popular in the same circles of mendicants from greater Magadha that led to the development of spiritual practices, as well as the popular concepts in all major Indian religions such as Samsara (the cycle of birth and death) and moksha (liberation from that cycle). The Sramanic traditions have a diverse range of beliefs, ranging from accepting or denying the concept of soul, fatalism to free will, idealisation of extreme asceticism to that of family life, renunciation, strict ahimsa (non- violence) and vegetarianism to permissibility of violence and meat eating.

Memorizing chronicles, dynastic histories and epic tales was the profession of different types of people, the sutas and the Magdhas, who were descendants of priest families of the Vedic period.
Shramana means seeker, one who performs acts of austerity.
Agraharika looked after the lands given in charity. Agrahara means grant given to Brahmins, it was perpetual, hereditary and tax free.
Parivrajaka means “One who roams around”. The Sanskrit word parivrajaka means renunciant & wanderer in English. Only a few parivrajakas have ever existed in history. Ajita Keshkambalin, Makhkhali Goshala, Gauthama Buddha, and Vardhamana Mahavira are a few well- known examples.**

### Question 4

With reference to the economic history of medieval India, the term ‘Araghatta’ refers to:

- (a) bonded labour
- (b) land grant made to military officers
- (c) waterwheel used in the irrigation of land
- (d) wasteland converted to cultivated land
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Medieval Terminology or keyword/ Economic History of Medieval India
Correct answer is Option (c): The ‘Persian Wheel’ has been referred to as Araghatta in ancient Sanskrit writings.

The term “ara-ghatta” derives from the words “ara,” which means “spoke,” and “ghatta,” which means “pot.”
There is evidence to support the theory that India was the origin of this method of drawing water from open wells.
It is referred to as the “cakka-vattakka”or the “ghati yantra” in the Panchatantra (3rd century BCE) and the Rajatarangini (12th century CE).

In the twelfth century, this term, also known as the “Araghattikka” or “arahattiyanara,” was frequently used to refer to a person or animal working the Araghatta.
The Persian wheel is a water lifting device used usually by draft animals, like bulls, buffaloes, or camels.
Baburnama provides a comprehensive explanation and a picture of the Persian Wheel which was in use in the Punjab province.
NOTE: In Our Past II, Pg 6 and 7 there is a discussion on the invention of the Persian wheel in irrigation, UPSC twisted the information and asked the question on Persian wheel. Also, do not confuse it with the ‘Agrahara system’. A ‘agrahara’ was a piece of land given to a Brahmana who was typically exempt from paying land revenue and other dues to the king and frequently granted the authority to collect these dues from the local people.**

Jainism vis-a-vis Buddhism


 
 
 
Similarities

•   Both were influenced by the Upanishads’ ideology as well as that of other Hindu religious groups. For instance, salvation is the ultimate aim of life.
•   Both groups welcomed members from various social classes while also catering to the socially outcast.
•   Both believed that Nirvana, or salvation, frees one from the cycle of perpetual birth and death.
•   Both placed more emphasis on moral principles than on engaging in ritualistic behaviour or paying homage to and worshipping God.







 
 
 
 
 
Differences

•   Jainism has endured in India throughout history, unlike Buddhism because Jains strictly adhere to their religious rules. However, Buddhism was nonetheless interpreted liberally in other cultures.
•   Jainism upholds a more comprehensive understanding of life. Every element of nature, both living and non-living, is said to have its own soul. However, Buddhism does not believe so.
•   Jainism believes that men and women who are householders cannot find salvation, in contrast to Buddhism, which does not make any distinctions between genders.
•   Jain teachings include opposition to animal sacrifices, including those made for spiritual purposes. In Buddhism, the concept of Ahimsa (non-violence) is different than in other religions. Ahimsa permits the eating of animal flesh where it is a necessity or traditional diet of the people.**

To break free from the circle of karma and reach salvation, Jainism teaches that one must lead a life of extreme austerity and penance. Jainism holds to the “theory of Karma” and the “transmigration of the soul.” Anekantavada: Stresses that there are many different facets to the ultimate truth and reality, or the “theory of plurality.” Syadavada: Literally, means the procedure of analysing various probability.
