# Environment Ecology


## Year: 2024

### Question 1

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which one of the following is the largest source of sulphur dioxide emissions?

- (a) Locomotives using fossil fuels
- (b) Ships using fossil fuels
- (c) Extraction of metals from ores
- (d) Power plants using fossil fuels
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Emissions that lead to high concentrations of SO2 generally also lead to the formation of other SOx. The largest sources of SO2 emissions are from fossil fuel combustion at power plants and other industrial facilities. EPA’s national ambient air quality standards for SO2 are designed to protect against exposure to the entire group of sulfur oxides (SOx).  SO2 is the component of greatest concern and is used as the indicator for the larger group of gaseous sulfur oxides (SOx).  Other gaseous SOx (such as SO3) are found in the atmosphere at concentrations much lower than SO2.**

### Question 2

Consider the following statements:

Statement I: India does not import apples from the United States of America.

Statement II: In India, the law prohibits the import of Genetically Modified food without the approval of the competent authority.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I.
- (b)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I.
- (c)   Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect.
- (d)   Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct.
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Statement-I is Incorrect:  Apples are one of the major imports from the USA. After India removed “retaliatory import duty” on US apples in September, imports of American apples have surged 40 times in three months, while traders are hopeful of regaining market share. In 2017-18, the import of US apples was a record of over 7 million boxes, which dropped to 50,000 boxes in the 2022–23.
Statement-II is correct: In India, the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, prohibits import, manufacture, use or sale of GM food without FSSAI’s approval.**

### Question 3

The organisms “Cicada, Froghopper, and Pond skater” are :

- (a)   Birds
- (b)   Fish
- (c)   Insects
- (d)   Reptiles
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
“Cicada, Froghopper, and Pond Skater” comes under the category of Insects. 
Cicada: Cicada is a family of more than 3,000 species of sound-producing insects. They are found in tropical and temperate areas worldwide and occur in deserts, grasslands, and forests. Cicadas have long been used in folk medicines, as religious and monetary symbols, and as an important source of food for humans and many other organisms.
Froghopper: Froghopper are species of small hopping insects which are worldwide in distribution and they produce a frothy substance known as spittle. The whitish nymph secretes a fluid through the anus that is mixed with a secretion from the abdominal glands. Air bubbles are introduced through a special valve on the abdomen to create a spittle that protects the larva from enemies and desiccation.
Pond Skater: Pond skaters are a truly remarkable group of insects that have evolved unique adaptations to thrive in aquatic environments. These small creatures, also known as water striders, can be found gliding effortlessly across the surface of ponds, lakes, and even slow-moving streams.**

### Question 4

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: Many chewing gums found in the market are a source of environmental pollution.

Statement-II: Many chewing gums contain plastic as gum base.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I
- (c)   Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect
- (d)   Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
 Chewing gum is known for its stress-relieving qualities as well as its ability to keep our mouths fresh. Soon, ‘chewing gum’ will be included as part of the drug delivery mechanism. Unfortunately, it has had some negative consequences. Modern chewing gum is made of non-biodegradable hydrophobic polymers together with artificial sweeteners and flavours. So, chewing this sort of synthetic material over a long time could produce some adverse effects. Each year, chewing gum generates more than 105 tonnes of “plastic” garbage. Thus, the discarded non-biodegradable residue of the gum produces plastic pollution. Every year, enormous sums of money are spent to clean up the abandoned gum from the streets. Again, it has a high potential to trap bacteria inside. Therefore, this widespread habit causes an additional nuisance in this pandemic situation.  Hence,  Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I**

### Question 5

Consider the following pairs:

Country
Animal found in its natural habitat


1.
Brazil
Indri


2.
Indonesia
Elk


3.
Madagascar
Bonobo

How many of the pairs given above are correctly matched?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   All three
- (d)   None
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Pair 1 is incorrectly matched: The Indri is endemic to the island country of Madagascar, specifically inhabiting the eastern rainforests. The unique geographical features and climate of Madagascar have facilitated the evolution of numerous species found nowhere else on Earth, including the Indri.
Pair 2 is incorrectly matched: Elk is the largest and most advanced subspecies of red deer, found in North America and in the high mountains of Central Asia. It is a member of the deer family. Recent genetic studies suggest that the “red deer” may have three species:

European red deer.
Tibetan–West Chinese red deer.
Elk.

Pair 3 is incorrectly matched: Bonobos and chimpanzees look very similar and both share 98.7% of their DNA with humans—making the two species our closest living relatives. Bonobos are usually a bit smaller, leaner, and darker than chimpanzees. They are found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Their discontinuous range extends from the Lualaba River in the east to the Kasai/Sankuru Rivers in the south and as far as the Congo River in the west and around Lake Tumba/Lake Mai-Ndombe.**

### Question 6

Consider the following statements :

1. Lions do not have a particular breeding season.

2. Unlike most other big cats, cheetahs do not roar.

3. Unlike male lions, male leopards do not proclaim their territory by scent marking.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp: 
Statement 1 is correct: Both Males and Females of the Lions are polygamous and breed throughout the year, but females are usually restricted to one or two adult males of their pride. In captivity, lions often breed every year, but in the wild, they usually breed no more than once in two years. Females are receptive to mating for three or four days within a widely variable reproductive cycle.
Statement 2 is correctly matched: There are four big cats that can roar: lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar – all of which belong to the genus Panthera. In these species, the epihyal bone, part of the voice box, is replaced by a ligament. This can be stretched, creating a larger sound-producing passage and thus a wider range of pitch. The bones of the cheetah’s voice box form a fixed structure, with divided vocal cords that vibrate with both in and out breaths. This structure is the same for all the ‘small’ cats. While this design enables these cats to purr continuously, it limits the range of other sounds and prevents them from being able to roar.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Leopards are known for their solitary nature and impressive hunting abilities. They are skilled predators that primarily hunt at night, using their incredible agility and stealth to catch a variety of prey. Their diet includes bugs, fish, antelope, monkeys, rodents, and more. Leopards are considered opportunistic hunters, adapting and targeting different species based on availability and their specific habitat. To avoid competition and conflicts, leopards establish their own territories, marking them with scent and claw marks on trees. Male leopards will fiercely defend their territories if they overlap with other males.**

### Question 7

Consider the following:

1. Battery storage

2. Biomass generators

3. Fuel cells

4. Rooftop solar photovoltaic units

How many of the above are considered “Distributed Energy Resources”?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   Only three
- (d)   All four
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Distributed energy resources, or DER, are small-scale energy systems that power a nearby location. DER can be connected to electric grids or isolated, with energy flowing only to specific sites or functions. DER include both energy generation technologies and energy storage systems. When energy generation occurs through distributed energy resources, it is referred to as distributed generation. Examples of distributed energy resources that can be installed include:

Roof top solar photovoltaic units




Wind generating units




Battery storage




Batteries in electric vehicles used to export power back to the grid
Combined heat and power units, or tri-generation units that also utilise waste heat to provide cooling
Biomass generators, which are fuelled with waste gas or industrial and agricultural by-products.
Open and closed cycle gas turbines
Reciprocating engines (diesel, oil)
Hydro and mini-hydro schemes




Fuel cells.**

### Question 8

Which one of the following shows a unique relationship with an insect that has coevolved with it and that is the only insect that can pollinate this tree?

- (a)   Fig
- (b)   Mahua
- (c)   Sandalwood
- (d)   Silk cotton
Explanation


**Ans: a
Exp:
The banyan fig tree Ficus microcarpa is famous for its aerial roots, which sprout from branches and eventually reach the soil. Aerial roots are roots above the ground that are found in diverse plant species like mangroves, banyan figs and orchids. The tree also has a unique relationship with a wasp that has coevolved with it and is the only insect that can pollinate it. Figs are known to sustain at least 1,200 bird and mammal species.  Fig trees were among the earliest domesticated crops and appear as sacred symbols in Hinduism, Buddhism and other spiritual traditions.**

### Question 9

Consider the following:

1. Butterflies

2. Fish

3. Frogs

How many of the above have poisonous species among them?

- (a)   Only one
- (b)   Only two
- (c)   All three
- (d)   None
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Butterflies: Hybrid Heliconius butterflies are Poisonous in nature. In nature, these butterflies are rare. Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno are both highly poisonous, having evolved to produce their own cyanide, and predators have learned exactly what both of these toxic insects look like. 
Fish: “Venomous” fish are those that can inject their toxic venom into victims, whereas “poisonous” fish are those that cause toxic symptoms only if they are eaten. For example: Lionfish, red-bellied piranha etc. 
Frogs: Frogs are amphibians which can survive both on land and water. Some of them can be poisonous also. Poison dart frogs are small, brightly colored amphibians that live on tropical rainforest floors across Central and South America. Poison dart frogs are named for the toxins they secrete from their skin, which have traditionally been used to tips of hunters’ weapons. For example, the Emberá and Noanamá Indigenous people in western Colombia have used the skin of golden poison frogs (Phyllobates terribilis) to tip blowgun darts for hundreds of years.**

### Question 10

With reference to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that are used in making many consumer products, consider the following statements:

1. PFAS are found to be widespread in drinking water, food and food packaging materials.

2. PFAS are not easily degraded in the environment.

3. Persistent exposure to PFAS can lead to bioaccumulation in animal bodies.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

- (a)   1 and 2 only
- (b)   2 and 3 only
- (c)   1 and 3 only
- (d)   1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products around the world since about the 1950s. 

People are most likely exposed to these chemicals by consuming PFAS-contaminated water or food, using products made with PFAS, or breathing air containing PFAS. Although PFOS use has been phased out, it can still be found in drinking water, groundwater, soil, and air. Hence, Statement 1 is correct.
PFAS molecules have a chain of linked carbon and fluorine atoms. Because the carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest, these chemicals do not degrade easily in the environment. Hence, Statement 2 is correct.
People may encounter different PFAS chemicals in various ways. Over time, people may take in more of the chemicals than they excrete, a process that leads to bioaccumulation in bodies. Hence, Statement 3 is correct.**

### Question 11

Consider the following:

1. Carabid beetles

2. Centipedes

3. Flies

4. Termites

5. Wasps

Parasitoid species are found in how many of the above kind of organisms?

- (a)   Only two
- (b)   Only three
- (c)   Only four
- (d)   All five
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Many animals are predators, parasites or parasitoids, using other animals as food. They use a great diversity of hunting strategies and behaviours to capture or feed on their prey. Invertebrate predators, parasites and parasitoids play an important role in keeping many animal populations under control.

Parasitoid is an insect whose larvae feed and develop within or on the bodies of other arthropods. Each parasitoid larva develops on a single individual and eventually kills that host. Most parasitoids are wasps, but some flies and a small number of beetles (carabid bettles), moths, lacewings, and even one caddisfly species have evolved to be parasitoids. Parasitoids alone number about 68,000 named species, and most have yet to be named and described. Realistic estimates of the total number of described and undescribed parasitoid species are about 800,000.
Predator: They are organisms that captures and eats another (the prey). This act is called predation. The predatory invertebrates include scorpions, centipedes, predatory mites, predatory snails and slugs, nematodes and planarian worms
Detritivores: Termites are detritivores that eat dead and decaying organic matter like logs of wood in a forest. They form an important link in the cycling of nutrients in the forests by breaking down wood and organic residues on the ground**

### Question 12

Consider the following statements:

Statement-I: The Indian Flying Fox is placed under the “vermin” category in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

Statement-II: The Indian Flying Fox feeds on the blood of other animals.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

- (a)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I
- (b)   Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I
- (c)   Statement -I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect
- (d)   Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Statement 1 is correct: The Indian Flying Fox is placed under the “vermin” category in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 due to its destructive tendencies towards fruit farms.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Bats are the only flying mammals in the world, and the Indian Flying Fox is one of the largest. The species, Pteropus giganteus , also called the Great Indian Fruit Bat, it eats fruits, feeding on the juice, and helps in seed dispersion and pollination, making them an integral part of the ecosystem.**

### Question 13

Consider the following materials:

1. Agricultural residues

2. Corn grain

3. Wastewater treatment sludge

4. Wood mill waste

Which of the above can be used as feedstock for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

- (a)   1 and 2 only
- (b)   2 and 4 only
- (c)   1, 2, 3 and 4
- (d)   1, 3 and 4 only
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen and electric all have a role to play in the decarbonization of aviation. SAF is vitally important as it can address decarbonization of fuel over its lifecycle, and this is now available to be used in all turbine engines including in mid and long-range aircraft. Therefore, understanding the feedstock landscape as well as the technology pathways is integral to maximising the production and supply of SAF. The production of SAF starts with one of five main families of raw materials: 

Corn grain




Oil seeds
Algae
Other fats, oils, and greases




Agricultural residues




Forestry residues




Wood mill waste




Municipal solid waste streams




Wet wastes (manures, wastewater treatment sludge)


Dedicated energy crops.**

1. Lion-tailed Macaque
2. Malabar Civet
3. Sambar Deer
How many of the above are generally nocturnal or most active after sunset?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp:
Option 1 is not correct: Lion-tailed Macaque also referred to as the wanderoo, inhabits the upper canopy of tropical evergreen rainforests and monsoon forests across various elevations. This species is endemic to the Western Ghats. They are diurnal. Conservation Status in India:

IUCN Red List: Endangered
Wildlife Protection Act, 1972: Schedule I
CITES: Appendix I

Option 2 is correct: Malabar Civet is endemic to the Western Ghats of India. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The Malabar civet is considered nocturnal and so elusive that little is known about its biology and ecology apart from habitat use.
Option 3 is correct: The sambar is a large deer native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia that has been listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List since 2008. Sambar are nocturnal or crepuscular animals and rest during the day under the cover of heavy forest. The males live alone for
much of the year, and the females live in small herds of up to 16 individuals.**

### Question 5

Which of the following organisms perform waggle dance for others of their kin to indicate the direction and the distance to a source of their food?
(a) Butterflies

- (b) Dragonflies
- (c) Honey Bees
- (d) Wasps
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Honeybees reside in colonies managed by a single queen overseeing the entire hive. Worker honeybees, all of which are females, constitute the only bees
typically observed flying outside the hive by the general populace. Bees perform two distinct types of dances: The Round Dance and The Tail-wagging or Waggle Dance. The waggle dance of honeybees has long been recognized as a behaviour that communicates information about resource location from a foraging worker to her nest mates.**

### Question 6

Consider the following statements:
1. Some mushrooms have medicinal properties.
2. Some mushrooms have psychoactive properties
3. Some mushrooms have insecticidal properties.
4. Some mushrooms have bioluminescent properties.
How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) Only three
- (d) All four
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp:
Statement 1 is correct: Mushrooms possess antibacterial properties, enhance the immune system, and aid in lowering cholesterol levels. Moreover, they serve as significant reservoirs of bioactive compounds. Consequently, certain mushroom extracts are utilised to support human health and are available in the form of dietary supplements.
Statement 2 is correct: Psychoactive properties refer to substances that influence brain function, resulting in alterations in mood, awareness, cognition, emotions, or behaviour. Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic compound found in specific mushrooms commonly known as magic mushrooms.
Statement 3 is correct: In recent times, there has been a growing discovery of insecticidal compounds within mushrooms.
Statement 4 is correct: Bioluminescence refers to the generation and release of light by living organisms. Panellus stipticus stands out as one of the most luminous bioluminescent mushrooms found on our planet. The newly discovered species, designated as Roridomyces phyllostachydis found in Meghalaya, now joins the ranks of the 97 recognised types of bioluminescent fungi worldwide.**

### Question 7

Consider the following statements regarding the Indian squirrels:
1. They build nests by making burrows in the ground.
2. They store their food materials like nuts and seeds in the ground.
3. They are omnivorous.
How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Statement 1 is correct: Tree squirrels typically live in wooded areas since they prefer to live in trees. Flying squirrels make their homes in tree holes or nests
that are built into the crooks of branches. Ground squirrels live up to their names. They dig burrows, a system of tunnels underground, to live in. Some
squirrels also hibernate in burrows during the winter to keep warm.
Statement 2 is correct: Nuts serve as the primary food source for these creatures year-round, especially during the winter months when they are preparing for hibernation. They store nuts by burying them underground, enabling retrieval during the winter season.
Statement 3 is correct: Squirrels are omnivores. Their diet primarily consists of nuts and fruits, although they will also consume seeds, insects, small mammals, reptiles, eggs, and occasionally even bird chicks.**

### Question 8

Consider the following statements:
1. Some microorganisms can grow in environments with temperature above the boiling point of water.
2. Some microorganisms can grow in environments with temperature below the freezing point of water.
3. Some microorganisms can grow in highly acidic environment with a pH below 3.
How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Microorganisms are classified into three primary groups on the basis of their preferred range of temperature:

Psychrophiles (cold-loving microbes)
Mesophiles (moderate-temperature-lovingmicrobes),
Thermophiles (heat-loving microbes).

Statement 1 is correct: Thermophiles are able to survive at temperatures up to 122°C. Thermophile. Hyperthermophiles induce the production of heat
shock proteins (HSPs), which are standard proteins responsible for responding to heat stress and safeguarding against cellular damage.
Statement 2 is correct: In Psychrophiles, the lowest temperature limit for life seems to be around −20 °C, which is the value reported for bacteria living in permafrost soil and in sea ice. The antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have the ability to bind to ice crystals through a large complementary surface and thereby create thermal hysteresis and lower the temperature at which an organism can grow.
Statement 3 is correct: pH 6.5-7 (neutral range) is best suited for bacterial growth. However some bacteria can grow at an acidic pH below 4 and are
called acidophiles. While some bacteria prefer an alkaline pH (8-9), are called alkalophiles. Molds and yeasts (fungus) require an optimum pH of about 5 to 6 for growth.**

### Question 9

Which one of the following makes a tool with a stick to scrape insects from a hole in a tree or a log of wood?
(a) Fishing cat

- (b) Orangutan
- (c) Otter
- (d) Sloth bear
Explanation


**Ans: b
Exp:
Orangutans have been known for making and using tools such as sticks for fishing out bugs from bark. Orangutan (genus Pongo) is any of three species of
Asian great apes found in rainforests on the Southeast Asian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) inhabits large portions of Borneo, whereas the Sumatran orangutan (P.abelii) and the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis) are limited to northern Sumatra. Orangutans possess cognitive abilities comparable to those of the gorilla and the chimpanzee, which are the only primates more closely related to humans.**

### Question 10

Consider the following:
1. Aerosols
2. Foam agents
3. Fire retardants
4. Lubricants
In the making of how many of the above are hydrofluorocarbons used?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) Only three
- (d) All four
Explanation


**Ans: d
Exp: 
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are a climate “Super- Pollutant” – Greenhouse gases with hundreds to thousands of times the heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide (CO). HFCs are synthetic gases used in air conditioning systems, aerosol propellants, foam-blowing agents, solvents, lubricants, and flame retardants. These gases were first developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, but after their rollout, it was learned that their release to the atmosphere during manufacturing processes and leakage during use, servicing, and retirement/ replacement of equipment poses a grave threat to our climate.**

---

### Question 11

Consider the following:
1. Aerosols
2. Foam agents
3. Fire retardants
4. Lubricants
In the making of how many of the above are hydrofluorocarbons used?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) Only three
- (d) All four
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp:
Statement I is correct: Carbon markets are trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon   markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One tradable carbon credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas reduced, sequestered or avoided.
Statement II is not correct: Carbon markets are trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. There is no transfer of resources from the
private sector to the state.**

### Question 12

Consider the following infrastructure sectors:
1. Affordable housing
2. Mass rapid transport
3. Health care
4. Renewable energy
On how many of the above does the UNOPS Sustainable Investments in Infrastructure and Innovation (S3i) initiative focus for its investments?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) Only three
- (d) All four
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
The UNOPS  Sustainable Investments in Infrastructure and Innovation (S3i) initiative was introduced in 2015 as a pilot project to investigate inventive approaches to financing sustainable infrastructure endeavours in developing nations. The initiative sought to capitalise on UNOPS’ proficiency and track record in providing infrastructure solutions that align with the requirements and ambitions of individuals and communities. The S3i initiative provides initial funding for significant projects in affordable housing, renewable energy, and health infrastructure. It does not emphasise investments in mass rapid transport infrastructure. Hence only Statements 1, 3 and 4 are correct.**

### Question 13

Consider the following statements regarding mercury pollution:
1. Gold mining activity is a source of mercury pollution in the world.
2. Coal-based thermal power plants cause mercury pollution.
3. There is no known safe level of exposure to mercury.
How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one

- (b) Only two
- (c) All three
- (d) None
Explanation


**Ans: c
Exp: 
Statement 1 is correct: Mercury is used in Artisanal Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM). The majority of the mercury emissions associated with the ASGM sector come from the burning of mercury-gold amalgam, which is responsible for 38% of all anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere.
Statement 2 is correct: Mercury is released into the atmosphere via the burning of coal and other fossil fuels. Because coal has far higher mercury content than other fossil fuels, coal-fired power stations frequently produce more mercury pollution than power plants that burn other fossil fuels.

Statement 3 is correct: There is no known safe level of exposure to mercury due to its extreme toxicity. The ideal level of mercury in the body is zero because it has no physiological advantages for either children or adults.**

---

### Question 14

Consider the following statements:
Statement-I: According to the United Nations’ World Water Development Report, 2022’, India extracts more than a quarter of the world’s groundwater withdrawal each year.
Statement-II: India needs to extract more than a quarter of the world’s groundwater each year to satisfy the drinking water and sanitation needs of almost 18% of the world’s population living in its Territory.

Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?
(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I
(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I

Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Nitrogen fixation
Option (a) is the correct answer: Alfalfa, Chickpea and Clover are nitrogen-fixing plants.
Nitrogen-fixation:

Nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen is taken from its molecular form (N2) in the atmosphere and converted into nitrogen compounds useful for other biochemical processes. Fixation can occur through atmospheric (lightning), industrial, or biological processes.
Nitrogen-Fixing Plants: A N-fixing crop is a natural way to provide plant-adjusted N without any industrial harm to nature.
Nitrogen fixing plants are:

Clovers, vetches, and peas are nitrogen- fixing plants used by farmers worldwide and in the Southern Great Plains of US in particular.
Peas or beans can be used as a summer nitrogen-fixing cover crop or harvested for food. Both ways, they enrich the soil with plant-suitable N. Southern peas prefer warm seasons and are sown when the soil temperature reaches 60F.
Beans: fava (aka faba, broad), alfalfa, green (aka French), runner, field, sweet, peanuts (aka groundnuts), soybeans, cream, black-eyed, or purple-hulled beans, lupins, lentils, cowpeas**

### Question 2

Among the following crops, which one is the most important anthropogenic source of both methane and nitrous oxide?

- (a) Cotton
- (b) Rice
- (c) Sugarcane
- (d) Wheat
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Greenhouse gases
Option (b) is the correct answer: Rice is one of the most important anthropogenic sources of both methane and nitrous oxide.
Agriculture and Greenhouse gases:

Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the two most important GHGs after carbon dioxide (CO2)
The most rapid increase in CH4 emission was found in natural wetlands and rice fields due to increased rice cultivation area and climate warming.
N2O emission increased substantially in all the biome types and the largest increase occurred in upland crops due to increasing air temperature and nitrogen fertilizer use.
Rice paddies are considered one of the most important sources of CH4 and N2O emissions, which have attracted considerable attention due to their contribution to global warming.





NOTE: Climate Smart Agriculture and GHG Emissions was very much in news, hence the question. Therefore, it is very important to holistically cover both the static and current affairs for UPSC Pre and Mains.**

- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: System of Rice Intensification
Option (d) is the correct answer: All of the given results come from the System of Rice Intensification.
System of Rice Intensification:

The System of Rice Intensification involves cultivating rice with as much organic manure as possible, starting with young seedlings planted singly at wider spacing in a square pattern; and with intermittent irrigation that keeps the soil moist but not inundated, and frequent inter cultivation with weed that actively aerates the soil.
SRI is not a standardised, fixed technological method.
It is rather a set of ideas, a methodology for comprehensively managing and conserving resources by changing the way that land, seeds, water, nutrients, and human labour are used to increase productivity from a small but well-tended number of seed.




Advantages of SRI
In situ Conservation




Higher yields – Both grain and straw
Reduced duration (by 10 days)
Reduced seed requirement
Lesser chemical inputs
Less water requirement
Reduced electricity consumption
Less chaffy grain %
Grain weight increased without change in grain size
Higher head rice recovery
Withstand cyclonic gales
Cold tolerance
Soil health improves through biological activity
Reduced methane production

 
 


Higher labour costs in the initial years
Difficulties in acquiring the necessary skills
Not suitable when no irrigation source available**

### Question 4

In the context of WHO Air Quality Guidelines, consider the following statements:

1. The 24-hour mean of PM2.5 should not exceed 15 ug/m3 and annual mean of 5 should not exceed 5 ug/m3.

2. In a year, the highest levels of ozone pollution occur during the period of inclement weather.

3. PM10 can penetrate the lung barrier and enter the bloodstream.

4. Excessive ozone in the air can trigger asthma.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

- (a) 1, 3 and 4
- (b) 1 and 4 only
- (c) 2, 3 and 4
- (d) 1 and 2 only
Explanation


**Ans: b       
Sub-Theme: Air quality
Statement 1 is correct: The 24-hour ceiling mean of PM 2.5 used to be 25 micrograms but has now dropped to 15.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Ozone at ground level is formed by the reaction with sunlight (photochemical reaction) of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) from vehicle and industry emissions and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by vehicles, solvents and industry. As a result, the highest levels of ozone pollution occur during periods of sunny weather and not during inclement weather.
Statement 3 is incorrect: PM is a common proxy indicator for air pollution. It affects more people than any other pollutant. While particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less, (≤ PM10) can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs, the even more health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, (≤ PM2.5). PM2.5 can penetrate the lung barrier and enter the blood system.
Statement 4 is correct: Excessive ozone in the air can have a marked effect on human health. It causes breathing problems, triggers asthma, reduces lung function and causes lung diseases. Ozone triggers asthma because it is very irritating to the lungs and airways.**

### Question 8

The “Miyawaki method” is well known for the:

- (a) Promotion of commercial farming in arid and semi-arid areas
- (b) Development of gardens using genetically modified flora
- (c) Creation of mini forests in urban areas
- (d) Harvesting wind energy on coastal areas and on sea surfaces
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Miyawaki Method of Urban Afforestation
Option (c) is the correct answer: Miyawaki method is a method of urban afforestation by turning backyards into mini-forests. It includes planting trees as close as possible in the same area which not only saves space, but the planted saplings also support each other in growth and block sunlight from reaching the ground, thereby preventing the growth of weeds. Thus the saplings become maintenance-free (self- sustainable) after the first three years. It helps to create a forest in just 20 to 30 years while through conventional methods it takes anywhere between 200 to 300 years.
Miyawaki Process

The native trees of the region are identified and divided into four layers — shrub, sub- tree, tree, and canopy.
The quality of soil is analysed and biomass which would help enhance the perforation capacity, water retention capacity, and nutrients in it, is mixed with it.
A mound is built with the soil and the seeds are planted at a very high density — three to five sapling per square meter.
The ground is covered with a thick layer of mulch.**

- (c) Wetlands play a vital role in maintaining sedimentation balance and soil stabilisation.
- (d) Aquatic plants absorb heavy metals and excess nutrients.
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Wetland Conservation
Option (d) is the correct answer: Natural wetlands have often been referred to as “earth’s kidneys” because of their high and long-term capacity to filter pollutants from the water that flows through them. Hence, Aquatic plants absorb heavy metals and excess nutrients.
Functions of Kidney and Wetland

Kidneys in our body remove wastes and extra fluid from our body. Our kidneys also remove acid that is produced by the cells of your body and maintain a healthy balance of water, salts, and minerals—such as sodium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium—in your blood.
In the same manner as sediment, excess nutrients and chemicals flow off of the land, wetlands filter the runoff before it reaches open water. Nutrients are stored and absorbed by plants or Sediment settles at the bottom after reaching an area with slow water flow.**

- (d) 1 and 4
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Food chain
Option (b) is the correct answer: Cyanobacteria and Diatoms are primary producers in the food chains of oceans.
Copepods:

Any member of the widely dispersed crustacean subclass Copepoda is referred to as one of them.
Free-living copepods form a crucial link in the food chain and are often assigned the role of “primary consumers”.
Copepods play a significant ecological role by feeding numerous fish species.

Cyanobacteria:

Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, are microscopic organisms found naturally in all types of water.
These single-celled organisms live in fresh, brackish (combined salt and fresh water), and marine water.
These organisms use sunlight to make their own food.

Diatoms:

Diatoms are photosynthesizing algae, they have a siliceous skeleton (frustule) and are found in almost every aquatic environment including fresh and marine waters, soils, in fact almost anywhere moist.
They are not mobile or can only move a small distance along a substrate by secreting mucilaginous material along a raphe, which is a groove or canal that resembles a slit.
Since they are autotrophic, they can only exist in the photic zone (water depths down to about 200m depending on clarity).

Foraminifera:

These are any unicellular organism of the rhizopodan order Foraminiferida (formerly Foraminifera), characterized by long, fine pseudopodia that extend from a uninucleated or multinucleated cytoplasmic body encased within a test, or shell.
All maritime environments contain foraminifera, which can be either planktic or benthic in nature.
In a variety of maritime habitats, foraminifera have been observed to feed mostly on bacteria, tiny diatoms, and nanoplankton.

Statement 1 is incorrect: Free-living copepods form a crucial link in the food chain and are often assigned the role of “primary consumers”.
Statement 2 is correct: Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, are microscopic organisms found naturally in all types of water. These organisms use sunlight to make their own food.
Statement 3 is correct: Diatoms are photosynthesising algae. They are found in almost every aquatic environment including fresh and marine waters. They are primary producers in oceanic food chain.
Statement 4 is incorrect: Foraminifera are found in all marine environments, they may be planktic or benthic in their mode of life. Foraminifera are recorded as feeding chiefly upon bacteria, small diatoms, and nanoplankton in a wide variety of marine environments.**

- (c) 1, 3 and 5 only
- (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Food Chain
Option (c) is the correct answer: Earthworms, Millipedes and Woodlice are Detritivores.

Detritivores also known as detritivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as faeces).
By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles.
Detritivores are an important aspect of many They can live on any type of soil with an organic component, including marine ecosystems, where they are termed interchangeably with bottom feeders.
Typical detritivorous animals include earthworm, millipedes, springtails, woodlice, dung flies, slugs, many terrestrial worms, sea stars, sea cucumbers, fiddler crabs, and some sedentary polychaetes such as worms of the family Terebellidae.**

### Question 4

In which one of the following biogeochemical cycles, the weathering of rocks is the main source of release of nutrients to enter the cycle?

- (a) Carbon cycle
- (b) Nitrogen cycle
- (c) Phosphorus cycle
- (d) Sulphur cycle
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Biogeochemical Cycles
Option (c) is the correct answer: Phosphate ions and other minerals gradually leak out of rocks as a result of weathering and rain.
Phosphorus Cycle:

The phosphorus cycle (unlike the carbon and nitrogen cycles) lacks an atmospheric component. Phosphorus is one of the most important nutrients in biological systems since it is a fundamental ingredient of nucleic acids, phospholipids, and several phosphorylated compounds.



Phosphate ions and other minerals gradually leak out of rocks as a result of weathering and rain. This inorganic phosphate is subsequently distributed in soils and water.
Plants take up inorganic phosphate from the soil and then these plants are consumed by animals. Phosphate is incorporated into organic molecules such as DNA in plants and animals. When the plants and animals die, it decays, and the organic phosphate is returned to the soil.
In the soil, organic forms of phosphate can be made available to plants by bacteria that break down organic matter into inorganic forms of This process is known as mineralisation.
Phosphorus from the soil can enter streams and eventually the seas. It can then be absorbed into sediments over time.**

- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Species Interaction
Option (d) is the correct answer: All species can establish a symbiotic relationship with other organisms.
Symbiotic Relationship:

A relationship between two (or more) species that may or may not be advantageous to one or both is referred to as symbiotic. The organisms could belong to the same species or to separate ones.
For eg., Coral has a symbiotic relationship (each gives something to the other and gets something back in return) with ‘zooxanthellae’ microscopic algae which live on coral.

Option 1 is correct: The relationship between cnidarians and dinoflagellate algae is termed “symbiotic” because both the animal host and the algae are benefiting from the association. It is a mutualistic interaction.
Option 2 is correct: Two common mutualistic relationships involving fungi are mycorrhiza (fungi and plant roots) and lichen (fungi and either cyanobacteria or green algae).
Option 3 is correct: Protozoa mostly represent a close mutualistic association between a protozoan and unicellular symbiont such as bacteria, cyanobacteria or/and unicellular algae or protozoans and a multicellular organisms such as ruminants, lower termites, wood-eating cockroaches, plants.**

There are two kinds of savannahs:

Tropical savannahs
Semi-tropical



Geographical Location:

All continents excluding Antarctica have
The largest savannahs are found close to the equator in Africa.
Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, which is well-known for its enormous wildebeest and zebra populations, is one of the most well-known African savannahs.
The park is also home to lions, leopards, elephants, hippos, and gazelles.

Statement 1 is incorrect: The savannah biome relies on their herd numbers and speed for survival, as the vast open areas provide little means of escape from quick predators.
Statement 2 is correct: The combination of high temperatures and little precipitation makes savannahs perfect areas for grass and brush fires during their dry seasons.
Statement 3 is correct: Many of the savannah biome animals are grazing herbivores that migrate through the region.
Statement 4 is correct: Savannah regions have two distinct seasons – a wet season and a dry season. There is very little rain in the dry season. In the wet season vegetation grows, including lush green grasses and wooded areas.
Statement 5 is incorrect: Soil properties influence the type of savannah and its vegetation but don’t contribute to checking it once formed.**

1. Permaculture farming discourages monocultural practices but in conventional chemical farming, monoculture practices are predominant.

2. Conventional chemical farming can cause an increase in soil salinity but the occurrence of such a phenomenon is not observed in permaculture

3. Conventional chemical farming is easily possible in semi-arid regions but permaculture farming is not so easily possible in such regions.

4. Practice of mulching is very important in permaculture farming but not necessarily so in conventional chemical farming.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 and 3
- (b) 1, 2 and 4
- (c) 4 only
- (d) 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Sustainable Agriculture
Statement 1 is correct: Permaculture is a totally integrated design system that’s modelled on nature. Permaculture farming promotes multi-cropping and integrated farming systems. While chemical farming is more suitable for monoculture cropping due to the use of crop- specific inputs like irrigation, chemical fertiliser and harvesting methods.
Statement 2 is correct: Conventional farming usually alters the natural environment, increases soil salinity, and eliminates biodiversity. Such problems are not seen in permaculture farming as it relies on organic fertilizers.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Chemical farming is based on the intense use of inputs like chemical fertilizers and irrigation that make the soil less fertile over time, thus restricting its practice in semi-arid regions. Thus, conventional farming is not suitable for semi-arid regions. Permaculture involves well-designed systems that don’t produce waste and permaculture tries to imitate well-designed systems. Thus, it can work in arid climates as well.
Statement 4 is correct: Mulching is an important component of Permaculture systems for promoting maximum efficiency.**

- (d) 2, 3 and 4 only
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Environment
Fertigation:

It is a technique for applying fertiliser where the drip irrigation system incorporates the fertiliser into the irrigation water. In this technology, irrigation is used to evenly disperse fertiliser solutions.
Fertigation is practised extensively in commercial agriculture and horticulture.
Fertigation is used to supplement nutrients that are already present or to make up for nutrient shortages found during plant tissue
It is usually practised on high-value crops such as vegetables, turf, fruit trees, and ornamentals.

Statement 1 is correct: Drip irrigation also avoids water spillage on the field which could have promoted weed growth or increased soil alkalinity due to water logging. So, fertigation also helps control weed growth and cut down alkalinity.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Rock phosphate is not soluble and thus not suitable for fertigation.
Statement 3 is correct: Accurate placement of nutrient, where the water goes the nutrient goes as well. Thus, increased nutrient absorption by plants.
Statement 4 is correct: Reduction of fertiliser, chemicals, and water. It leads to reduction in the leaching of chemicals into the water supply.**

- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: (d)
Sub-Theme: World Biome/Adaptation
Option (d) is the correct answer: Hard and waxy leaves, Tiny leaves and Thorns instead of leaves are the modifications that occur in the desert areas to inhibit water loss.
Desert Biome:

Both warm and mid-latitude deserts have a predominance of xerophytic or drought- resistant plants.
This comprises cacti, thorny bushes, wiry grasses with extensive roots, and scatted dwarf acacias.
In order to gather moisture and search for ground water, the majority of desert shrubs have lengthy roots that are widely
Plants with few or no leaves typically have needle-shaped, waxy, leathery, or hairy foliage to reduce water loss through
Many kinds of grasses and herbs have tough, thick skins on their seeds that serve as protection when the plants are dormant.**

### Question 2

Which of the following statements best describes “carbon fertilization”?

- (a) Increased plant growth due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- (b) Increased temperature of Earth due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- (c) Increased acidity of oceans as a result of increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- (d) Adaptation of all living beings on Earth to the climate change brought about by the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
Explanation


**Ans: (a)
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Environment
Carbon fertilisation

It is the artificial enrichment of the atmosphere of greenhouses with carbon dioxide, an essential nutrient for plants and vegetables. It also goes by the name of “Carbon Dioxide Fertilization.”
It is used to raise production levels in order to do so both qualitatively and quantitatively.
It can be used to grow nearly any form of vegetable (asparagus, celery, lettuce, tomatoes, aubergines, etc.), greenhouse fruit (strawberries), and ornamental plants, and is especially suited for cold climates.

Impact on agriculture:

Increase in the photosynthetic rate: It results in an increase in the instantaneous rate of photosynthesis in C3 plants; and increases the transpiration efficiency of the leaf (C3 and C4 plants).
Increases the water use efficiency: During high concentration of carbon dioxide, plants maintain narrow openings of leaf surface which protects them from water loss.
Faster plant growth enhances food production and allows for the sequestration of more carbon dioxide.
Plants distribute a greater proportion of photosynthate to roots under high concentrations of atmospheric carbon
The reproductive biomass growth, as well as vegetative biomass growth, is usually increased by elevated carbon dioxide.**

### Question 3

With reference to agricultural soils, consider the following statements:

1. A high content of organic matter in soil drastically reduces its water holding capacity.

2. Soil does not play any role in the sulphur cycle.

3. Irrigation over a period of time can contribute to the salinization of some agricultural lands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Environment
Statement 1 is incorrect: Soil water holding capacity is the amount of water that a given soil can hold for crop use. Soil texture and organic matter are the key components that determine soil water holding capacity. Organic matter influences the physical conditions of a soil in several ways.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Sulphur is one of three nutrients that are cycled between the soil, plant matter and the atmosphere. The sulphur cycle describes the movement of sulphur through the atmosphere, mineral and organic forms, and through living things.
Statement 3 is correct: Salinization is a major problem associated with irrigation, because deposits of salts build up in the soil and can reach levels that are harmful to crops.




NOTE: Again, same story!! Carefully observe the extreme keyword ‘drastically’ and ‘any’ in statements 1 and 2 respectively. Not all but most of the time these extreme statements happen to be wrong.**

- (c) 2, 4 and 5
- (d) 1, 2, 3 and 5
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Environment
Conservation Agriculture (CA):

It is a farming system that promotes minimum soil disturbance (i.e. no tillage), maintenance of a permanent soil cover, and diversification of plant species.
It enhances biodiversity and natural biological processes above and below the ground surface, which contribute to increased water and nutrient use efficiency and to improved and sustained crop

According to FAO’s website there are three principles of Conservation of Agriculture:

Minimum mechanical soil disturbance: It refers to low disturbance no-tillage and direct seeding. The disturbed area must be less than 15 cm wide or less than 25% of the cropped area (whichever is lower).
Permanent soil organic cover: Three categories are distinguished: 30-60%, >60- 90% and >90% ground cover, measured immediately after the direct seeding operation. Area with less than 30% cover is not considered as CA.
Species diversification: Rotation/ association should involve at least 3 different crop species. The rotation of crops is not only necessary to offer a diverse “diet” to the soil micro organisms, but as they root at different soil depths, they are capable of exploring different soil layers for**

### Question 2

Due to some reasons, if there is a huge fall in the population of species of butterflies, what could be its likely consequence/consequences?

Pollination of some plants could be adversely
There could be a drastic increase in the fungal infections of some cultivated plants.
It could lead to a fall in the population of some species of wasps, spiders and birds.

Select the correct using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Biotic Interaction
Pollination:

Transfer of pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is termed pollination. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array of adaptations to achieve
Kinds of Pollination: Depending on the source of pollen, pollination can be divided into three types –




Autogamy
Geitonogamy
Xenogamy



Statement 1 is correct: This is basic knowledge that Bees, butterflies and other biotic agents play a vital role in the pollination of plants and the production of crops by transporting pollen grains from one place to another.
Statement 2 is incorrect: There is no credible source or research behind this and moreover the extreme keyword ‘drastic’ in the statement makes it more absurd and irrelevant.
Statement 3 is correct: These are some of the common predators of butterflies: wasps, ants, parasitic flies, birds, snakes, toads, rats etc. The decline in the butterfly population would therefore adversely affect the food chain




NOTE: if we observe statement 2 carefully, the examiner used the word “drastic increase” which is extreme and absolute. It also connotes all of sudden change in the present situation. So, elimination of statement 2 left us with option (a) and option (c). Now it is common understanding that decline in butterfly population would adversely affect the food chain, so the reduction in other dependent species such as wasps, spiders and birds. So, statement 3 is correct.**

### Question 3

Which of the following statements can help in water conservation in agriculture?

Reduced or zero tillage of the land
Applying gypsum before irrigating the field
Allowing crop residue to remain in the field

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Agriculture and Environment

Statement 1 is correct: Conservation Tillage includes no-till farming or zero tillage is a way of growing crops or pasture from year to year without disturbing the soil through tillage. Zero tillage helps in soil moisture conservation.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Though, Gypsum helps in dissolution of the salt clay pan found in soils that hinder the percolation of water and helps in water conservation. But the official answer key published by UPSC shows option (c) as the correct answer. Thus, going by the UPSC key statement 2 is wrong.
Statement 3 is correct: Crop residues act as mulches and reduce evaporation losses and protect the soil from direct impact of raindrops, thus controlling crusting and sealing processes.**

### Question 4

Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a standard criterion for:

- (a) Measuring oxygen levels in blood
- (b) Computing oxygen levels in forest ecosystems
- (c) Pollution assay in aquatic ecosystems
- (d) Assessing oxygen levels in high altitude regions
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Water Pollution
Option (c) is the correct answer: Pollution assay in aquatic ecosystems is based on Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) criterion.

Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of the amount of organic waste that pollutes water.
BOD is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by bacteria in decomposing the organic wastes present in water. It is measured in milligrammes per litre of water of oxygen.
The higher value of BOD indicates low DO content of water.
BOD is not a reliable method for assessing water pollution because it only includes biodegradable elements.

NOTE: This is an easy and straight question from NCERT Class 11 Chemistry Chapter 14 (Environmental Chemistry), though the non- science graduates may not find interest in reading class 11 and 12 science NCERTs this particular chapter is very important for the environment and ecology.**

3. Genetic engineering can be used to create microorganisms specifically designed for

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 1 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: (c)
Sub-Theme: Eco-Engineering
Benefits of Bioremediation:

It minimises damage to ecosystems by just using natural methods.
In order to remove toxins from soil and groundwater, bioremediation frequently takes place underground, where pumped-in nutrients and bacteria can be used.
As a result, compared to other cleanup techniques, bioremediation causes less disruption to the neighbourhood
A minor change or addition designed to the environment, such as molasses, vegetable oil, or simple air optimises conditions for microbes to flourish, thereby accelerating the completion of the bioremediation
It produces comparatively few harmful byproducts (mainly due to the fact that contaminants and pollutants are converted into water and harmless gases like carbon dioxide).
Since it doesn’t require a lot of labour or expensive equipment, it is less expensive than most cleanup techniques.

Statement 1 is correct: Bioremediation uses naturally occurring organisms to break down hazardous substances into less toxic or non-toxic substances.
Statement 2 is incorrect: Not all contaminants are easily treated by bioremediation using microorganisms. For eg. Heavy metals such as cadmium and lead are not readily absorbed or captured by microorganisms.
Statement 3 is correct: The use of genetic engineering to create organisms specifically designed for bioremediation has great potential. For e.g. Alcanivorax, a bacteria with oil-eating abilities, can be used to create species that are much more capable of cleaning oil spills.




NOTE: UPSC asks standard conceptual questions on Eco-engineering every year. Bioremediation, biofuels, and genetic engineering are some such standard concepts. Hence, conceptual clarity of this particular topic is very important. Also, always be cautious of extreme statements and words such as ‘readily’ (quickly) and ‘completely’.**

1. Production of algae-based biofuels is possible in seas only and not on continents.

2. Setting up and engineering the algae-based biofuels production requires high level of expertise/technology until the construction is

3. Economically viable production necessitates the setting up of large-scale facilities which may raise ecological and social concerns.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 and 3 only
- (c) 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Eco-Engineering
Biofuels

A biofuel is any hydrocarbon fuel that is created in a short amount of time—days, weeks, or even months—from organic matter (living or once-living material).
Biofuels may be solid, liquid or gaseous in nature:

Solid: Wood, dried plant material, and manure
Liquid: Bioethanol and Biodiesel
Gaseous: Biogas



Statement 1 is incorrect: Algaculture (farming algae) can be initiated on land unsuitable for agriculture or saline water or wastewater.
Statement 2 is correct: Producing algae for biofuels (excluding simple seaweed production) requires significant capital investments, which may be a significant barrier in developing countries that have a weak investment climate.
Statement 3 is correct: Using the land allotted to food crops to algal biofuel reduces the amount of food available for humans, resulting in an increased cost for both the food and the fuel produced. This is an ecological as well as economic concern.**

- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Global warming mitigation/Carbon sequestration
Option (d) is the correct answer: All are potential sites for carbon sequestration.
Carbon Sequestration:

Carbon sequestration is a process to capture and store CO2 to curb global It is captured from the air, industries or power stations and stored permanently underground.

Types of CO2 Sequestration:

Terrestrial Carbon Sequestration: It is the process through which CO2 from the atmosphere is absorbed by trees and plants through photosynthesis and stored as carbon in soils and biomass (tree trunks, branches, foliage, and roots)
Geologic Carbon Sequestration: CO2 can be stored, including oil reservoirs, gas reservoirs, unmineable coal seams, saline formations and shale formations with high organic content.
Ocean Carbon Sequestration: Oceans absorb, release and store large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.

Statement 1 is correct: Uneconomic coal seams can be used to store CO2 because the CO2 molecules attach to the surface of coal.
Statement 2 is correct: CO2 is sometimes injected into declining oil fields to increase oil recovery.
Statement 3 is correct: Other potential sites are gas reservoirs, saline formations and shale formations with high organic content.




NOTE: UPSC has asked about “potential sites”. If we see options, all the given options could be potential sites for carbon sequestration. It is always advisable to stay focused while reading questions and try to identify such keywords from the given questions.**

NOTE: UPSC usually puts such “about us” page questions not with the primary desire of getting correct answers from the aspirants, but rather to eliminate candidates. Now with a calm and composed mind we can make some intelligent guesses to reach the correct answer. Though it’s a bit risky but still if we consider ‘unique’ as an extreme word with G20 then the first statement becomes wrong. And the second statement looks like a factual one with no extreme word like ‘only’, not all but in most cases such type of question ought to be right. Please use due diligence while attempting this method.**

2. The Agreement aims to limit greenhouse gas emissions so that the rise in average global temperature by the end of this century does not exceed 2 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.

3. Developed countries acknowledged their historical responsibility in global warming and committed to donate $1000 billion a year from 2020 to help developing countries to cope with climate change.

Select the correct answer using the code given below.

- (a) 1 and 3 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Summits and Conventions
Statement 1 is incorrect: It was only “agreed” by 195 nations in Paris at the conference. The agreement will enter into force only after 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification.
Statement 2 is correct: Paris Summit COP21 aims to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. It requires all parties to put forward their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which are voluntary in nature.
Statement 3 is incorrect: Developed countries will work to define a clear roadmap on ratcheting up climate finance to USD 100 billion (not USD 1000 billion) by 2020.
Paris Summit COP21:

Legally binding International Treaty on Climate Change.
It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 & entered into force on 4 November 2016.
Aim: to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
It requires all parties to put forward their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which are voluntary in nature.





NOTE: Following basic information about COP21 from any newspaper/monthly magazine was enough to solve this rather difficult question. Observe statement 3 carefully, the examiner has just made his efforts to mention “USD100Bn as USD1000Bn” to make the statement incorrect and confuse aspirants. If we eliminate option 3, we get the correct answer i.e. only 2.

Itn 2017, UPSC asked question about the spread of the Himalayas, Western Ghats and Pulicat lake with the similar trick of changing/interchanging
In 2016, UPSC asked question on “Astrosat” with the similar trick of changing/interchanging numbers.

The key takeaway from the above question is to read numbers very carefully and cautiously.**

The necessity for nitrogen-fixing bacteria decreases as soil nitrogen levels increase.
The soil becomes more acidic and nitrate leaches into the groundwater when nitrogenous fertilisers are used excessively or inappropriately.
Fertilizers in agriculture increase inputs of nutrients to soils affecting their pH value
The molecule of nitrogen change soil pH in the form of uncharged urea molecule, the cation ammonium and the anion nitrate
The conversion of Nitrogen from one form to the other involves the generation or consumption of acidity and the uptake of urea, ammonium or nitrate by plants will also affect the acidity of the soil. Due to the leaching process, these substances accumulate underground.

Statement 1 is incorrect: More nitrogen in the soil leads to less need for nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
Statement 2 and 3 are correct: Excessive/ inappropriate use of nitrogenous fertilizers increases the acidity of soil and the leaching of nitrate into the groundwater.
NOTE: Excessive or inappropriate use of anything will have a negative impact on the environment, there should be a balance in everything. Now, look at the extreme keyword in the first statement. ‘Proliferation’     which   means ‘rapid increase’, think logically, is it possible that the use of excessive nitrogenous fertilizer will proliferate the nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in soil? Having said that, it is also advisable to read this topic thoroughly as it is very important and high yielding both in terms of prelims and mains.**

### Question 15

The most important strategy for the conservation of biodiversity together with traditional human life is the establishment of:

- (a) Biosphere reserves
- (b) Botanical gardens
- (c) National parks
- (d) Wildlife sanctuaries
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: National Parks/Tiger Reserve/ Biosphere Reserve/Wildlife Sanctuary/Wetland
Option (a) is the correct answer: Biosphere reserves are legally protected regions where people and the environment can coexist while honouring each other’s needs. These areas might be terrestrial, coastal, or a combination of both. They are recognised under UNESCO’s MAB programme and nominated and established by the relevant nations. Hence, the most important strategy for the conservation of biodiversity together with traditional human life is the establishment of Biosphere Reserve.
Zonation Of Biosphere Reserve:



Core Areas

The central portions of biosphere reserves are strictly protected zones, which are frequently publicly owned lands that are subject to legal protection, such as a previously established national park, wilderness area, or wildlife refuge. The  core  region,  however,  could  be privately held or be a part of non- governmental groups.



Buffer Zones

Facilities for education,  training, tourism, and recreation may be located nearby the core area(s). In many biosphere reserves, the buffer zone  is  viewed  as  a  region  where scientific study is conducted and human use is less intense than what might be found in the transition zone.



Transition Areas

The  most     remote area      where   a society  supports  socioculturally  and environmentally sound  economic  and human activity.

- (b) Limited sunlight and paucity of nutrients
- (c) Water limits and fire
- (d) None of the above
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Ecological Succession
Option (c) is the correct answer: Water limits and Fire restrict trees to replace the grasses as a part of an ecological succession.
Grassland Ecosystem:

Grassland ecosystems are an early stage of succession in regions where the mature ecosystems are forests.
Grass ecosystems, on the other hand, are climax ecosystems in grassland regions when there is insufficient precipitation to support a forest.
Grass that dries out during the dry season ignites fires that decimate other plant species and their seeds.
In areas with little rainfall, where plants cannot thrive, grasslands develop.
A grassland environment transforms into a desert ecosystem as a result of constraining forces including water scarcity and forest
Therefore, the ecological succession of grassland is desert. It is, however, notable that the soil of the grassland ecosystem is rich in nutrients and organic matter and provides the largest biomass.**

Productivity:

Productivity is the rate of biomass
Productivity is measured in mass per unit volume per unit time.
The quantity of biomass or organic matter created by plants during photosynthesis per unit area during a certain time is referred to as primary production.
Gross primary productivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter during photosynthesis.

A considerable amount of GPP is utilized by plants in respiration.
Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R), is the net primary productivity (NPP). GPP – R = NPP.


Secondary productivity is the rate at which consumers create new organic matter.**

A food chain is the successive transfer of nutrients and energy from one creature to
A food chain shows a straightforward and isolated relationship and only one component of the food or energy flow.
g. Grasses → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake→ Hawk/Eagle.
A trophic level is the name given to each step in the food chain.
The place an organism holds in a food chain determines its trophic level.
Top carnivores are at the end of a food chain, which begins with producers.
Types of Food Chains: 1) Grazing food chain and 2) Detritus food chain
Grazing food chain: The consumers which start the food chain, utilising the plant or plant part as their food, constitute the grazing food chain.
Detritus food chain: This type of food chain starts from organic matter of dead and decaying animals and plant bodies from the grazing food Dead organic matter or detritus feeding organisms are called detritivores or decomposers.
Statement 1 is correct: A food chain is a linear flow of energy and nutrients from one organism to another.

Statement 2 is incorrect: Food chains are found within the populations of a species but not among all species (Man won’t eat man).
Statement 3 is incorrect: A food web illustrates the numbers of each organism which are eaten by others, not the food chain.**

### Question 1

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment describes the following major categories of ecosystem services— provisioning, supporting, regulating, preserving and cultural.

Which one of the following is a supporting service?

- (a) Production of food and water
- (b) Control of climate and disease
- (c) Nutrient cycling and crop pollination
- (d) Maintenance of diversity
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme:
Option (c) is the correct answer: Nutrient cycling and crop pollination are supporting services under Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA):

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) was initiated in 2001 by the United 
The objective of the MA was to evaluate how changing ecosystems might affect human well-being as well as the scientific foundation for any necessary action to improve the systems’ conservation and sustainable usage, as well as their contribution to human well-being.
Ecosystem services to the society in the form of –




Provisioning services: food, raw materials, genetic resources, water, etc
Regulating services: carbon sequestration and climate regulation
Cultural services: tourism and religion
Supporting services: that are necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services such as nutrient recycling and soil formation, etc.**

### Question 2

What would happen if phytoplankton of an ocean is completely destroyed for some reason?

1. The ocean as a carbon sink would be adversely affected.

2. The food chains in the ocean would be adversely affected.

3. The density of ocean water would drastically decrease.

Select the correct answer using the codes given below:

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Food Chain
Statement 1 is correct: Phytoplankton prefer iron and iron pulls carbon out of the atmosphere during photosynthesis, thus the complete destruction of phytoplankton would certainly affect the carbon sinking mechanism of the ocean.
Statement 2 is correct: In a balanced ecosystem, phytoplankton provide food for a wide range of sea creatures, thus Phytoplankton are considered the primary producers in the marine food chain, they are called the ‘grass of the sea’. Thus, the destruction of phytoplankton will certainly have an adverse effect on the marine food chain.
Statement 3 is incorrect: First of all the use of extreme words like ‘drastically’ in the statement is itself a red flag. Now coming to the main part of the statement, if the phytoplankton of an ocean is completely destroyed for some reason, then it may affect the marine food chain because when the phytoplankton disappeared, that affects the zooplankton, which then affects the small fish that ate the zooplankton, and the large fish that ate the small fish. So it’s like dominoes falling. Phytoplankton and macroalgae → zooplankton → small fish → large fish. Therefore, it may hardly affect the density of water.**

### Question 4

Consider the following agricultural practices:

Contour bunding
Relay cropping
Zero tillage

In the context of global climate change, which of the above helps/help in carbon sequestration/storage in the soil?

- (a) 1 and 2 only
- (b) 3 only
- (c) 1, 2 and 3
- (d) None of them
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Agriculture practices
Option (b) is the correct answer: Zero Tillage helps in carbon sequestration/storage in the soil. Zero Tillage:

It is the process where the crop seed will be sown through drillers without prior land preparation and distributed in the soil where previous crop stubbles are present.
Zero tillage not only reduces the cost of cultivation it also reduces the soil erosion, crop duration, irrigation requirement and weed effect which is better than tillage. It also helps in carbon sequestration in the soil.

Contour bundling:

Contour bundling involves the construction of banks along the contours.
Terracing and contour bunding divide the hill slope into numerous small slopes, check the flow of water, promote absorption of water by soil and save soil from erosion.
Retaining walls of terraces control the flow of water and help in reducing soil erosion.

Relay Cropping:

Relay Cropping is the process of growing one crop, then planting another crop (usually a cover crop) in the same field before harvesting the first.
This helps avoid competition between the main crop and the intercrop.
It also uses the field for a longer time since the cover crop usually continues to grow after the main crop is harvested.**

### Question 1

In the context of ecosystem productivity, marine upwelling zones are important as they increase marine productivity by bringing the:

Decomposer microorganisms to the surface.
Nutrients to the surface.
Bottom-dwelling organisms to the surface.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3
- (d) 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-theme: Ecosystem productivity/Energy Flow
Option (b) is the correct answer: Marine upwelling brings nutrients to the surface.
Upwelling:

It is a process in which deep, cold water of the ocean rises toward the surface.
Winds blowing across the ocean surface pushes the water away. Water then rises up from beneath the surface to replace the water that was pushed away. This process is known as “upwelling.”
Upwelling is usually observed at the equator where surface waters diverge, in the vicinity of Antarctica where the east and west winds drift, and along coastlines where the wind blows in a way that the Ekman Transport pushes water away from the coast.
The water that upwelling causes to rise to the surface is usually cooler and nutrient-
Surface waters are “fertilised” by these nutrients, which means that they frequently have high biological As a result, good fishing spots are usually found where upwelling is frequent
Statement 1 and 3 are incorrect: At the upwelling zone no such movement of organisms can be observed, they would remain at their position.
Statement 2 is correct: Deep ocean water during upwelling is usually extremely cold and nutrient- rich. We frequently find very productive waters in upwelling locations as a result.**

### Question 2

If a tropical rainforest is removed, it does not regenerate quickly as compared to a tropical deciduous forest. This is because

- (a) The soil of rainforest is deficient in nutrients
- (b) Propagules of the trees in a rainforest have poor viability
- (c) The rain forest species are slow-growing
- (d) Exotic species invade the fertile soil of rainforest
Explanation


**Ans: a
Sub-Theme: Types of ecosystem/Forest/ Biomes
Option (a) is correct: The high volume of rainfall in tropical rainforests leaches out most of the nutrients from the soil and makes these soils virtually useless and nutrient deficient for agricultural purposes.
Option (b) is incorrect: Propagule is a vegetative structure that can become detached from a plant and give rise to a new plant, e.g. a bud, sucker, or spore. Seed bearing plants are more significant than Propagules in rainforests.
Option (c) is incorrect: In the rainforest, the plant species generally compete with each other for sunlight and while doing so they grow so fast that they rapidly consume the nutrients from the decomposed leaf litter. As a result, most of the nutrients are contained in the trees and other plants rather than in the soil.
Option (d) is incorrect: Though the exotic invasive species are a threat to rainforests (E.g. Most plantation crops like rubber, palm etc.) but it is also true that the rainforest soil is heavily leached, nutrient deficient, and thus less fertile.**

- (c) 1, 3 and 5
- (d) 3, 4 and 6
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Biodiversity Hotspot
Biodiversity Hotspot:

Biodiversity hotspots are regions with high species richness and a high degree of
In 1988, the British biologist Norman Myers coined the term “biodiversity hotspot” as a biogeographic region characterized both by exceptional levels of plant endemism and by serious levels of habitat loss.
In 1989, Conservation International (CI) adopted Myers’ hotspots as its institutional model and provided the following qualifications for a hotspot:

Species endemism: It includes at least 1,500 vascular plant species that are unique to the planet (endemic species).
Degree of Threat: Primary native vegetation has lost at least 70% of its original coverage.



Statement 1 and 3 are correct: Species richness and endemism is one of the major criteria which must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (> 0.5% of the world’s total) as endemics.
Statement 5 is correct: ‘Degree of Threat’ is also a major criteria for the recognition of biological hotspots. It has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat. (It must have 30% or less of its original natural vegetation). In other words, it must be threatened.
Statement 2, 4 and 6 are incorrect: Are not the criteria for the recognition of Biodiversity Hotspots.**

### Question 6

Consider the following statements:

1. Biodiversity is normally greater in the lower latitudes as compared to the higher latitudes.

2. Along the mountain gradients, biodiversity is normally greater in the lower altitudes as compared to the higher altitudes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 2 only
- (c) Both 1 and 2
- (d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation


**Ans: c
Sub-Theme: Biomes
Patterns of Biodiversity:

Latitudinal gradients: The diversity of plants and animals varies widely over the world.
The diversity of species declines as we move from the equator to the pole.
Than temperate or polar regions, the tropics are home to more species.

Statement 1 is correct: Diversity of plants and animals is not uniform throughout the world. Species diversity decreases as we move away from the equator towards the pole.
Statement 2 is correct: Elevational diversity gradient (EDG) is an ecological pattern where biodiversity changes with elevation. The EDG states that species richness tends to increase as elevation increases, up to a certain point, creating a “diversity bulge” at middle elevations, after which it decreases with altitude. Therefore, it is true that along the mountain gradients, biodiversity is normally greater in the lower altitudes as compared to the higher altitudes.**

### Question 10

There is a concern over the increase in harmful algal blooms in the seawaters of India. What could be the causative factors for this phenomenon?

Discharge of nutrients from the estuaries.
Run-off from the land during the monsoon.
Upwelling in the seas.

Select the correct answer from the codes given below:

- (a) 1 only
- (b) 1 and 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3 only
- (d) 1, 2 and 3
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Water Pollution
Algal Bloom:

A rapid rise in the population of algae in an aquatic system is known as an algal bloom, marine bloom, or water bloom.
Algal blooms can appear in both marine and freshwater habitats.
“Harmful algal blooms (HAB)” are blooms that can affect wildlife or the environment.
Harmful Algal Bloom can lead to fish die- offs, cities cutting off water to residents, or states having to close fisheries.

Responsible Factors for ALGAL BLOOM



•   Nutrients


•   Temperature


•   Light






•   Stable (Calm Waters) Conditions


•   Turbidity


•   Aquaculture Operations



Statement 1 is correct: Nutrients promote and support the growth of algae and Cyanobacteria. The Eutrophication (nutrient enrichment) of waterways is considered as a major factor behind the increase in harmful algal blooms.
Statement 2 is correct: External sources include runoff and soil erosion from fertilized agricultural areas, erosion from river banks, river beds, land clearing (deforestation), and sewage effluent.
Statement 3 is correct: Water that rises to the surface as a result of upwelling is typically colder and is rich in nutrients, which again leads to algal blooms.**

### Question 11

Human activities in the recent past have caused the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but a lot of it does not remain in the lower atmosphere because of

Its escape into the outer stratosphere.
The photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the oceans.
The trapping of air in the polar ice caps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

- (a) 1 and 2
- (b) 2 only
- (c) 2 and 3
- (d) 3 only
Explanation


**Ans: b
Sub-Theme: Carbon Mitigation Strategies
Carbon Sequestration:

To slow down global warming, carbon sequestration involves the capture and storage of CO2. It is captured from the air, industries or power stations and stored permanently underground.
This promotes Long-term reserve of CO2 or forms of carbon to control temperatures.
Lowering of the amount of GHGs present in the air due to combustion of fossil fuels.

3 main steps to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS):

Trapping & separating CO2 from other gases
Transporting captured CO2 to storage location
Storing CO2 far from the atmosphere, either in the deep ocean or underground.

Statement 1 is incorrect: Some amount of CO2 does escape but not much CO2 is denser than Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon (the main components of the atmosphere) and thus this tend to stay more in the lower atmosphere, however, this does not stop some of it moving to the upper atmosphere by the process of diffusion.
Statement 2 is correct: The photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the oceans is natural carbon sequestration.
Statement 3 is incorrect: The trapping of CO2 by polar ice is not known.**

### Question 13

The formation of ozone hole in the Antarctic region has been a cause of concern. What could be the reason for the formation of this hole?

- (a) Presence of prominent tropospheric turbulence; and inflow of chlorofluorocarbons
- (b) Presence of prominent polar front and stratospheric clouds; and inflow of chlorofluorocarbons.
- (c) Absence of polar front and stratospheric clouds; and inflow of methane and chlorofluorocarbons.
- (d) Increased temperature at polar region due to global warming
Explanation


**Ans: b
 Sub-Theme: Ozone Depletion
Option (b) is the correct answer: Formation of Polar front, Polar Stratospheric Clouds lead to formation of ozone hole in the Antarctic region.

The formation of the ozone hole in the Antarctic has been an annual occurrence (in the months of September, October and November, due to a set of special meteorological and chemical conditions that arise at the South Pole, such as the presence of strong polar front, polar stratospheric clouds and increasing inflow of human- made chemicals like CFCs, etc.

Antarctic Ozone Hole:

The Antarctic “ozone hole” was discovered by British Antarctic Survey scientists Farman, Gardiner and Shanklin in 1985.

Causes:

Due to an increase in halocarbons (a compound in which the hydrogen of a hydrocarbon is replaced by halogens like chlorine, bromine, iodine etc.) in the atmosphere.
Presence of Polar Front which is a large area of low pressure and cold air that surrounds both of Earth’s poles.
The Cl-catalysed ozone depletion is enhanced in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) convert “reservoir” compounds into reactive free radicals (Cl and ClO), which in turn deplete ozone. In this way, PSCs accelerate ozone depletion.**

- (b) Carbon credits are awarded to countries or groups that have reduced greenhouse gases below their emission quota
- (c) The goal of the carbon credit system is to limit the increase of carbon dioxide emission
- (d) Carbon credits are traded at a price fixed from time to time of the United Nation Environment Programme
Explanation


**Ans: d
Sub-Theme: Carbon Mitigation Strategies
Carbon Credit:

A carbon credit is a permit that allows the company the right to emit 1 ton of CO2 or its equivalent.
One credit permits the emission of a mass equal to one ton of carbon dioxide
Options (a), (b) and (c) are correct: The carbon credit system was ratified in conjunction with the Kyoto Protocol under UNFCCC to encourage groups or countries to reduce carbon emissions.
Option (d) is incorrect: Carbon credit prices are traded on an exchange and their prices are never fixed.**
