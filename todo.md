add a new learn mode for quiz -> in this mode a user does not give a quiz.. but it shows the correct answer in the bottom of the question itself like they can just scroll a little to reveal the anwer! this mode should be global stored in DB and configurable from settings. can add a new table for global config options or something and fetch from there for frontend. allow interactive clicking on answers still but show answer in the bottom of quiz thanks. 

Add a copy button for each test the aspirant can use to copy the question and its options to clipboard to ask to chatgpt thanks.

prefer themes -> not only use themes.
add web search for questions. 
try to intertwine questions with current affairs.
check pyqs for information thanks.
check current news and all. use thematic areas.


default 100% in hard difficulty.

think about removing question style

multiple eras too.

current affairs -> after answer or after question -> relevance of the question in bracket i.e. referance.

eras -> focuss too much on the style of eras... change prompt to say its dominant and have it generate other styles too thanks
