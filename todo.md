add a new learn mode for quiz -> in this mode a user does not give a quiz.. but it shows the correct answer in the bottom of the question itself like they can just scroll a little to reveal the anwer! this mode should be global stored in DB and configurable from settings. can add a new table for global config options or something and fetch from there for frontend. allow interactive clicking on answers still but show answer in the bottom of quiz thanks. 

Add a copy button for each test the aspirant can use to copy the question and its options to clipboard to ask to chatgpt thanks.
