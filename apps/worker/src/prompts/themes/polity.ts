STRATEGIC NOTES & TRAP CUES

CORE STRATEGY - "SWITCHBOARDS" & "TRAPS":
- Focus on articles that behave like 'switchboards': 13, 32/226, 72/161, 110/117, 123/213, 200, 239AA, 280, 323A/323B
- Parliamentary Process: Distinguish bill taxonomy (ordinary, money, finance I/II), speaker certification, committee roles (PAC vs Estimates vs CoPU)
- Study Tip: Pair a body with: Article/Statute → Composition/Tenure → Removal → Money Source → One non-obvious power
- Federalism Mini-Grid: For Local Bodies/Councils -> Who constitutes? Who funds? Who dissolves?
- GST Council Trap: Vote weights (Centre 1/3, States 2/3); 3/4th majority for decisions
