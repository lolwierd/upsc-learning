STRATEGIC NOTES & TRAP CUES

CORE STRATEGY - "GRIDS" & "HIERARCHIES":
- Acts/Rules: Scope → Authority → Penalty → Appeal Route → 1 current tweak
- Protected Areas: Who notifies → What allowed/prohibited → Buffer/Core logic
- Conventions: Objective → Appendices → Compliance tool
- Living Lists: Keep a monthly updated list of Parks/Reserves/Ramsar sites

INSTITUTIONAL GRID TRAPS:
- NBWL Standing Comm (Project Clearance); ZSI (Fauna) vs BSI (Flora) vs FSI (Forest reports)
- Clearances: EC (Env Clearance) vs CTO (Consent to Operate); Role of EAC (Expert Appraisal) vs SEAC
- Ramsar Traps: Criteria 5 & 6 (Waterbirds/Fish)
- IUCN Trap: "Regionally Extinct" vs "Extinct in the Wild" ladder

CHEMISTRY & SCIENCE TRAPS:
- Ozone formation (Ground level vs Stratospheric)
- PM2.5 vs PM10 sources and health impacts
- "All mangroves are halophytes" (True) but "All biosphere reserves are national parks" (False)
- CITES appendices classification vs WPA schedules

2025-26 WATCHLIST:
- Biodiversity (2023): Wider exemptions; Role of BMCs & PBRs; Access & Benefit Sharing (ABS)
- Wildlife Protection (2022): Rationalised schedules; New "CITES Schedule"; Live elephant transfer caveats
- Forest (Conservation) Amendment: Exemptions for linear projects & security infra; "Deemed forest" state identification
- Pollution: GRAP revisions; CAQM mandate vs CPCB; Photochemical Smog vs London Smog
- Waste: EPR frameworks (Tyres, Batteries); Compliance portals
- Global Treaties: Basel (Haz waste), Rotterdam (PIC), Stockholm (POPs), Minamata (Mercury)
- Energy & Climate: RPO/HPO trajectories; Offshore wind bids; Green Hydrogen obligations
- Green Credit vs Carbon Market: Distinct mechanisms under Energy Conservation Act (2001/2022)
- New Ramsar sites/IBA upgrades; Cheetah project updates
